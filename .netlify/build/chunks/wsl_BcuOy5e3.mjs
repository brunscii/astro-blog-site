It is a way of letting you install a linux distribution inside of windows. Why would you want to do this? It's simple, Linux is a wonderful environment with a plethora of built-in tools. Having access to this environment and tools inside of windows means not having to worry about running a virtual machine. It means not having to dual-boot, or run a separate computer to have access to these tools. It also allows you to access the windows environment with these linux tools.\r\n\r\nHaving used Linux for many years means certain features and tools are second nature. WSL allows us to have the best of both worlds. An easy example is being able to run `grep` in windows. You could also run `vim` or other *nix style environments. Another is having the ability to deploy your code in a linux environment without having to send it to another machine. This can increase productivity for cross-platform development. \r\n\r\nYou can use it to run GIT, or a database easily with little setup. This means you can run a production server and the production on the same machine. \r\n\r\n## How does WSL work\r\n\r\nWe know there are differences in Linux and Windows on a fundamental level. From file/folder structure to the function of these systems. So how do we get these different systems to work together. Traditionally we used a virtual machine to emulate the hardware of another computer and run the different operating system. This is limited as the guest and host OS can't communicate effectively. As we know communication is the key to success. \r\n\r\nWith WSL we can have the guest operating system be installed on the host operating system without the need for a virtual machine platform. We eliminate the need for VirtualBox or Hyper-V in this case. While we don't need them for WSL they still provide important use when testing and deploying images.\r\n\r\nWSL allows the linux kernel to run on top of the windows kernel by using a kernel interface. This allows us to run a shell or a background service as if we were running linux natively on the hardware with a little more overhead.\r\n\r\nAccording to the wsl program:\r\n```text\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

There is a small selection of Linux distributions that are already built for you. \r\n\r\nSome of the most common are Ubuntu, Debian, Suse, and Kali.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for the easiest way to get started with WSL then you can't get easier than installing 2 apps from the MS Store.\r\n\r\n![Ubuntu from the MS Store](/public/blogContent/wsl/MSStoreWSLUbuntu.png)\r\n\r\nSo what do we get with this installation?\r\n\r\nWell, we get a working copy of Ubuntu for starters. \r\n\r\nTO BE CONTINUED...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using the terminal\r\n\r\nAccording to the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) it is a simple process.\r\n***Microsoft describes this as a 6 step process but if you are running a modern install of windows then you can probably just do steps 1, 3 and 6 and be fine. This would make this more like a 3 easy step program.***\r\n\r\n#### Step 1 Enable WSL\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 2 Make sure you are using a supported version of Windows\r\n\r\n- x64 systems need Version 1903, Build 18362 or later.\r\n- ARM64 systems need Version 2004, Build 19041 or later.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3 Enable Virtual Machine feature\r\n\r\n> I thought you said WSL didn't use a VM?\r\n\r\nWell, yes and no. WSL 1 didn't use VM's but WSL 2 uses Windows hypervisor feature to run the linux kernel seamlessly with Windows. \r\n\r\nTo enable Windows hypervisor feature we simply enter the following into the terminal with administrator privlidges.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 4 Download the Linux kernel\r\n\r\nDownload the latest kernel update from the [Microsoft Store](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi) and run the update package.\r\n\r\n#### Step 5 Set WSL 2 as default\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nwsl --set-default-version 2\r\n```\r\nThis will set the default version of wsl to 2.\r\n\r\n#### Step 6 Install Linux Distro from MS Store\r\n\r\n![MS Store](/public/blogContent/wsl/MSStoreWSL.png)\r\n\r\nOpen the MS Store and install a Linux distro.\r\n\r\n## Once it's running\r\n\r\nWe finally return to the list of available options for the `wsl` command. Let's start with the basics. \r\n\r\n##### Lists\r\n\r\nHere's how we list the wsl distros installed on the machine `wsl --list`. We have the following opetions we can add to this:\r\n\r\n        --all\r\n            List all distributions, including distributions that are\r\n            currently being installed or uninstalled.\r\n\r\n        --running\r\n            List only distributions that are currently running.\r\n\r\n        --quiet, -q\r\n            Only show distribution names.\r\n\r\n        --verbose, -v\r\n            Show detailed information about all distributions.\r\n\r\n        --online, -o\r\n            Displays a list of available distributions for install with 'wsl.exe --install'.\r\n\r\nLet's make a not of a couple of those. `--running` allows us to see the running distros and `--online` allows us to see the available distributions we can install using wsl and an internet connection. Wsl will download the distro from the microsoft store.\r\n##### Terminate\r\nWhile running a WSL distro isn't as demanding on your system as a full VM, it is still a resource drain and there are cases when you might want to stop that. To terminate a distribution you can use `wsl --terminate <wsl name>`. So for example, let's say you wanted to terminate a distro named kali-linux. You would enter \r\n```powershell\r\nwsl --terminate kali-linux\r\n```\r\n##### Shutdown\r\n\r\nIf you want to shutdown all running distributions then you can use `wsl --shutdown`. This will shutdown all of the running distributions.\r\n\r\n##### Install\r\n\r\nUsing `wsl --install <distro>` we can install a distro straight from wsl.exe. Which distros do they have? Well, look back at our `--list` section. If we use `wsl --list --online` we will get a list of available distros. \r\n\r\n    The following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.\r\n    Install using 'wsl.exe --install <Distro>'.\r\n\r\n    NAME               FRIENDLY NAME\r\n    Ubuntu             Ubuntu\r\n    Debian             Debian GNU/Linux\r\n    kali-linux         Kali Linux Rolling\r\n    SLES-12            SUSE Linux Enterprise Server v12\r\n    SLES-15            SUSE Linux Enterprise Server v15\r\n    Ubuntu-18.04       Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\r\n    Ubuntu-20.04       Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\r\n    OracleLinux_8_5    Oracle Linux 8.5\r\n    OracleLinux_7_9    Oracle Linux 7.9\r\n\r\nThis list changes as new versions of distributions are released and updated. This is, at least for me, the easiest way of installing a wsl distro. Simply enable wsl, and install a distro from the app. Microsoft takes care of the rest.\r\n\r\n##### Running\r\n\r\nSo we can run the default distribution by using the `wsl` command with no arguments. This is fine but what if you want to run the one you installed after that? You can choose your distribution by using the `--distribution` or `-d` option. \r\n\r\nLet's say we want to run Debian from our installed distros. We would use \r\n`wsl -d Debian`.";
