This article assumes that you know about RAM, what it is and what it is used for. The point of this is to give standards, explain the differences, and help to prepare for the A+ test.\r\n\r\nSo what does Double Data Rate mean? If you think of the clock speed as a square wave then the data is transmitted on the rise of the clock signal in a single data rate transmission. For the double data rate you use the rise and fall of the clock signal's square wave. \r\n\r\nThe double in the data rate says nothing of the memory speed or bandwidth. In modern times DDR is the standard for pretty much all RAM. \r\n\r\nSo what are the different types of DDR memory?\r\n\r\n## Types of DDR Memory\r\n\r\n| RAM Type | Speed | Pins | bandwidth |\r\n| ---      | ---   | ---  | ---       |\r\n| SDRAM    |  | 168| |\r\n| DDR1     |  | 184| |\r\n| DDR2     |  | 240 | |\r\n| DDR3     |  | 240 | |\r\n| DDR4     |  | 288 | |\r\n| DDR5     |  | 288 | |";
