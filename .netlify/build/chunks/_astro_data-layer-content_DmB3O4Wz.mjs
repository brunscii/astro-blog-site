It is a wealth of knowledge and courses that allows for students to work at their own pace. \r\nNo deadlines, no costs, and no hassle is how freeCodeCamp operates. They offer a range of certificates that each require the completion of special projects.\r\nThe certs range from Front End development to Data Analysis with Python and Pandas.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has completed some of these certificates while learning, this review is a first hand look at my experience. \r\n\r\n## What do they offer?\r\n\r\nfreeCode camp offers certificates in:\r\n- Responsive Web Design\r\n- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures\r\n- Front End Development Libraries\r\n- Data Visualization\r\n- Relational Database\r\n- Back End Development\r\n- Quality Assurance\r\n- Scientific Computing with Python\r\n- Data Analysis with Python\r\n- Information Security\r\n- Machine Learning with Python\r\n- College Algrbra with Python\r\n- A2 English for Developers\r\n- Foundational C# with Microsoft\r\n\r\nThey also offer interview prep stuff such as:\r\n- The Odin Project\r\n- Coding Interview Prep\r\n- Project Euler\r\n- Rosetta Code\r\n\r\nThis is an ever-growing list of coursework that is free. Free as in free beer, not freedom of expression. \r\nThe only cost is the time you spend on learning and making projects.\r\n\r\n## What I learned\r\n\r\nAs someone who learned web development through freeCodeCamp I may be somewhat biased. That being said, I do love how easy they make learning.\r\nThe site breaks down simple concepts like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript into bite sized chunks. \r\nThe REACT and Redux parts of the Front End Development Libraries course where much harder but still manageable.\r\n\r\nI have completed the Responsive Web Design, Front End Development Libraries, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Data Analysis with Python.\r\n\r\n### Responsive Web Design\r\n\r\n> In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.\r\n> \r\n> First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.\r\n> \r\n> Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid. --<cite>freeCodeCamp</cite>\r\n\r\nThis cert was a great intro into HTML, CSS, and how the interact with each other. Going in to this cert I had only wrote very basic HTML for myspace, yes I am THAT old. \r\nI learned how HTML is structured and how to think in that DOM structure. \r\nI also learned how to shape this structure with CSS. \r\n\r\nYou can finish this Certificate by completing basic websites that look like a 2 year old made them. I would recommend against this, or at least for you to re-finish the challenges with better versions of your sites if you ever want to showcase them.\r\n\r\nThat being said, will anyone be impressed with this certificate? Probably not.\r\n\r\nThis is a good intro cert that will help you in finishing the other certificates.\r\n\r\n### Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures ( legacy )\r\n\r\n\r\n> While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.\r\n>\r\n> Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.\r\n>\r\n> Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).\r\n>--<cite>freeCodeCamp</cite>\r\n\r\nThis certifcate is all about learning the basics of how to write code with javascript. The main focus is fundamental javascript and it does not focus on the interaction with the DOM that we learned about in the Responsive Web Design cert. This is good if you want to just learn basic programming or didn't do the other cert.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Front End Development Libraries\r\n\r\n> Now that you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, level up your skills by learning some of the most popular front end libraries in the industry.\r\n> \r\n> In the Front End Development Libraries Certification, you'll learn how to style your site quickly with Bootstrap. You'll also learn how to add logic to your CSS styles and extend them with Sass.\r\n> \r\n> Later, you'll build a shopping cart and other applications to learn how to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React and Redux. --<cite>freeCodeCamp</cite>\r\n\r\nIn this certificate we explore React and how to make SPAs.\r\n\r\nThis was my introduction to React and I am kind of glad that I learned it this way with class components first. This might not be the most common or practical way to write react components currently, but it provides an insight into how react works.\r\n\r\nThis was a fairly straight forward set of courses that allowed me to acquire a skill.\r\nI would however say that it is almost necessary to learn from other sources as well. I used a lot of YouTube myself.\r\n\r\nAfter learning React I went on to use it with TypeScript to create a podcast app as well as a weather app. These were personal learning projects that helped me after taking this cert and are possible thanks to this course.\r\n\r\n### Data Analysis With Python\r\n\r\n> Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.\r\n> \r\n> In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. By the end of this certification, you'll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data. --<cite>freeCodeCamp</cite>\r\n\r\nThis was a great introduction into using jupyter notebooks, python, and data analysis. While I think this cert should have more content, such as statistics and the specifics of python as a language; I did learn a lot here.\r\n\r\nHaving this focus on mainly pandas and numpy isn't a bad thing but a little more aout data reporting tools and trend analysis would have also been nice. If you mixed this cert with the Google Data Analytics cert on coursera then you might have a decent set of classes that would get you started in the world of data analytics. \r\nThe coursera cert did a better job of preparing you to work with data on a daily basis and how to find, clean, and present the data. This cert was good for getting to know the tools of the trade, since the Google one used R and some tools I found less intuitive.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion \r\n\r\nThere are many other certifications that they offer and that I will most likily complete given the free time. These are just my opinions on the ones in which I participated.\r\n\r\nfreeCodeCamp has many YouTube videos on computer science subjects from multiple teachers. \r\nMany of these videos are several hours long and very inclusive. \r\nThese videos are great when watched in chunks so you can follow along with the instructor.\r\n\r\nThe challenges and projects are often good examples of what you can do. They may not be something you would want to showcase as a proof of work but you can build on the experience for your own personal projects.\r\n\r\nfCC claims that it takes around 300 hours to complete each cert. This is possible for the uninitiated, however existing developers and computer science grads will take less time.\r\n\r\nThat being said, if it takes you 300 hours then that is ok as well. The goal is to learn an initiate one's self with the topic at hand. Learning is the goal of freeCodeCamp and it acheives it internationally without subscription costs or sponsored ads.\r\n\r\nThe information in the curriculum is enough to get started, but often requires additional information from their 9000+ articles and tutorials.","src/content/blog/learning_platforms/freeCodeCamp.md","3b0ee7e5649dd25a",{html:123,metadata:124},"<h2 id=\"what-is-freecodecamp\">What is freeCodeCamp</h2>\n<p>As the name says, freeCodeCamp is a free code camp.

That being said, I do love how easy they make learning.\r\nThe site breaks down simple concepts like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript into bite sized chunks.\r\nThe REACT and Redux parts of the Front End Development Libraries course where much harder but still manageable.</p>\n<p>I have completed the Responsive Web Design, Front End Development Libraries, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Data Analysis with Python.</p>\n<h3 id=\"responsive-web-design\">Responsive Web Design</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you’ll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.</p>\n<p>First, you’ll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you’ll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.</p>\n<p>Finally, you’ll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid. —<cite>freeCodeCamp</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This cert was a great intro into HTML, CSS, and how the interact with each other. Going in to this cert I had only wrote very basic HTML for myspace, yes I am THAT old.\r\nI learned how HTML is structured and how to think in that DOM structure.\r\nI also learned how to shape this structure with CSS.</p>\n<p>You can finish this Certificate by completing basic websites that look like a 2 year old made them. I would recommend against this, or at least for you to re-finish the challenges with better versions of your sites if you ever want to showcase them.</p>\n<p>That being said, will anyone be impressed with this certificate? Probably not.</p>\n<p>This is a good intro cert that will help you in finishing the other certificates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures--legacy\">Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures ( legacy )</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you’ll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.</p>\n<p>Once you have the fundamentals down, you’ll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>Along the way, you’ll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).\r\n—<cite>freeCodeCamp</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This certifcate is all about learning the basics of how to write code with javascript. The main focus is fundamental javascript and it does not focus on the interaction with the DOM that we learned about in the Responsive Web Design cert. This is good if you want to just learn basic programming or didn’t do the other cert.</p>\n<h3 id=\"front-end-development-libraries\">Front End Development Libraries</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now that you’re familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, level up your skills by learning some of the most popular front end libraries in the industry.</p>\n<p>In the Front End Development Libraries Certification, you’ll learn how to style your site quickly with Bootstrap. You’ll also learn how to add logic to your CSS styles and extend them with Sass.</p>\n<p>Later, you’ll build a shopping cart and other applications to learn how to create powerful Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React and Redux. —<cite>freeCodeCamp</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this certificate we explore React and how to make SPAs.</p>\n<p>This was my introduction to React and I am kind of glad that I learned it this way with class components first. This might not be the most common or practical way to write react components currently, but it provides an insight into how react works.</p>\n<p>This was a fairly straight forward set of courses that allowed me to acquire a skill.\r\nI would however say that it is almost necessary to learn from other sources as well. I used a lot of YouTube myself.</p>\n<p>After learning React I went on to use it with TypeScript to create a podcast app as well as a weather app. These were personal learning projects that helped me after taking this cert and are possible thanks to this course.</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-analysis-with-python\">Data Analysis With Python</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.</p>\n<p>In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you’ll learn the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. By the end of this certification, you’ll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data. —<cite>freeCodeCamp</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was a great introduction into using jupyter notebooks, python, and data analysis. While I think this cert should have more content, such as statistics and the specifics of python as a language; I did learn a lot here.</p>\n<p>Having this focus on mainly pandas and numpy isn’t a bad thing but a little more aout data reporting tools and trend analysis would have also been nice. If you mixed this cert with the Google Data Analytics cert on coursera then you might have a decent set of classes that would get you started in the world of data analytics.\r\nThe coursera cert did a better job of preparing you to work with data on a daily basis and how to find, clean, and present the data. This cert was good for getting to know the tools of the trade, since the Google one used R and some tools I found less intuitive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There are many other certifications that they offer and that I will most likily complete given the free time. These are just my opinions on the ones in which I participated.</p>\n<p>freeCodeCamp has many YouTube videos on computer science subjects from multiple teachers.\r\nMany of these videos are several hours long and very inclusive.\r\nThese videos are great when watched in chunks so you can follow along with the instructor.</p>\n<p>The challenges and projects are often good examples of what you can do. They may not be something you would want to showcase as a proof of work but you can build on the experience for your own personal projects.</p>\n<p>fCC claims that it takes around 300 hours to complete each cert. This is possible for the uninitiated, however existing developers and computer science grads will take less time.</p>\n<p>That being said, if it takes you 300 hours then that is ok as well. The goal is to learn an initiate one’s self with the topic at hand. Learning is the goal of freeCodeCamp and it acheives it internationally without subscription costs or sponsored ads.</p>\n<p>The information in the curriculum is enough to get started, but often requires additional information from their 9000+ articles and tutorials.</p>",{headings:125,localImagePaths:150,remoteImagePaths:151,frontmatter:152,imagePaths:154},[126,129,132,135,138,141,144,147],{depth:40,slug:127,text:128},"what-is-freecodecamp","What is freeCodeCamp",{depth:40,slug:130,text:131},"what-do-they-offer","What do they offer?",{depth:40,slug:133,text:134},"what-i-learned","What I learned",{depth:50,slug:136,text:137},"responsive-web-design","Responsive Web Design",{depth:50,slug:139,text:140},"javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures--legacy","Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures ( legacy )",{depth:50,slug:142,text:143},"front-end-development-libraries","Front End Development Libraries",{depth:50,slug:145,text:146},"data-analysis-with-python","Data Analysis With Python",{depth:40,slug:148,text:149},"conclusion","Conclusion",[],[],{title:116,description:117,draft:30,category:31,pubDate:153},"01/16/2024",[],"learning_platforms/freeCodeCamp.md","lifestyle/retail",{id:156,data:158,body:161,filePath:162,digest:163,rendered:164,legacyId:211},{title:159,description:160,draft:23},"Working retail, working tech","What it's like to work retail while being technically inclined.","Table of Contents:\r\n- [What's the point](#whats-the-point)\r\n- [Barrier to Entry](#barrier-to-entry)\r\n- [Abundance of options](#abundance-of-options)\r\n- [Escape](#trying-to-escape-the-world-of-retail)\r\n- [Exisitnetial dread](#existential-dread)\r\n\r\n## What's the point?\r\n\r\nFor millions of Americans working retail is a reality that they can't escape. Over the last decade I have worked in retail, from stocker to management, and have met people from just about every walk of life. From business owners to former IT workers, people from different backgrounds flock to retail positions. The real question is why, what are the benefits, downfalls, and is it for you?\r\n\r\nI just want to start by saying that retail workers are an essential part of our economy. Without people to stock shelves, run registers, clean, and everything in between, there would be no commerce. That being said the retail worker is considered one of the lowest forms of employee. Why is this? Is it the barrier to entry for these positions? Is it the abundance of people that will work the position? Is it the lack of skill required for the position? Perhaps it is a mix of these things that keeps the retail worker in the shadows.\r\n\r\nThe point of this post is to explain the pros, cons, and some examples of retail work. This isn't designed to sway your opinion for or against retail postitions, but instead to share some experiences. The astute of you will probably be able to determine my views on the subject, but that is niether here nor there. This is just a way of sharing some of my personal experience from over 10 years of retail work.\r\n\r\n### Barrier to entry\r\n\r\nWith the low barrier to entry anyone can apply and get a job in the field. There is literally a job for anyone. Can't run a register, you can probably push a broom around. Can't push a broom, you can probably check receipts or spot people with equipment. Can't deal with people, there's always the accounting/cash side of things. In my tenure I have worked with many disabled people that were able to work and provide value to the overall store. You can think of working at a big retailer like community college. The barrier to entry is low enough that just about anyone can get in, while there are still some people that get rejected.\r\n\r\nWho gets rejected? The unfair bit of retail is the drug testing. People fail them all of the time. It is ultimately unfair to judge someone based on how they spend their free time. If someone were to apply for a position at a grocery store after their trip to Colorado then they could easily fail a drug test for something that is legal in another state. Controversial take, many people can trick drug tests so you only weed out the honest drug users. That being said you don't stop the crafty ones that are willing to lie and cheat to get a job.\r\n\r\nWhat about background checks? Those also pose a risk for potential employees. Most companies require a background check for felonies and sometimes even credit scores. This is supposed to weed out the dangerous people or those that might steal. This is just another way or biasing the system. There are plenty of nonviolent, non-theft related felonies, and as always this archaic system doesn't leave room for interpretation. Some places even require a credit check to show if someone is in debt. The though behind that is that those in debt are more willing to steal. Realistically speaking, if someone is going to steal, then they probably wouldn't be in debt in the first place. This is more of a way of sifting out the \"undesirables\" than a real measure of security. With most things, this should be left up to manager's discretion; however, most retail chains don't even trust their management teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Abundance of options\r\n\r\nAs a former hiring manager, I have first hand experience pulling from the application pool. Believe me when I say there was no real shortage of applicants. There may have been times in which we had more or less depending on the season but there was usually someone to call in for an interview. Qualification on the other hand was the problem. If I want to hire a supervisor and no one internal is qualified, then it might be a struggle to find an external hire to fill the position. That being said, the labor shortage is a more of a political buzzword than a reality. \r\n\r\nYes there may have been a shallower applicant pool during the pandemic, but generally speaking applicants are abundant when the pay and position is reasonable. Talk to HR and hiring manager and you'll find out that when the economy got tighter so did the hiring pool. I've seen job postings for software developers where the posting would collect 900 applications in 24 hours. How can there be a shortage of applicants for retail when there is such an abundance of developers? Pay and benefits. No one wants to work themselves to death for minimum wage. This isn't a labor shortage, this is a pay shortage. Working 40 hours a week for $7.25 an hour is less than $1200 a month. That wont even cover rent for most people. If there is a low number of applicants it is up to the company to adjust starting pay and benefits to make the position more enticing. \r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThere are a few benefits to working in retail. There is the low barrier to entry and the plethora of jobs. The fact that you don't need to have a formal education or a certain amount of experience means that just about anyone cane get a job. See the earlier section for the pitfalls. The abundance of jobs means that you can grab a job and work while getting into the field of your choice. Sometimes, at higher levels, the money is actually decent. For example, a Walmart store manager can start at $125,000 with the potential of a bonus that is 125% of that. I have personally seen store managers make $90,000 bonuses. That being said, you can also expect to spend the majority of your time and energy on the store.\r\n\r\nOne of the other main benefits is that you can learn on the job. Learning how to merchandise, increase sales, and properly service customers are skills that will carry over to any other field. Some places even have academies to send their management teams. While these skills might not be the best on a resume, they can carry over from company to company. Inventory control is essential to managing inventory flow, merchandising teaches visual styling, and customer service is a universal skill when in a front facing environment.\r\n\r\n## Trying to escape the world of retail\r\n\r\nThere exists a problem in which people start a retail job and then give up on their dreams. If anything it is a common joke among retail workers. People grab a job and then settle into that job. The problem is that the either exert all of their energy in that job or get too comfortable and stop looking for something better. \r\n\r\nSo what is the solution? Keep working on you skills in the field that you want to learn. Want to be a web developer? Keep making web sites. Want to work in IT? Study for the A+ or keep applying to entry level roles. \r\n\r\n have personally seen many people leave retail for a new career. I worked with someone that unloaded trucks and stocked. He went to school at the same time and later got a job as a diesel mechanic. This was a rare case in retail. I'm not saying that people can't escape the void of retail, but it isn't that common. Most of the people you see \"going to school\" live in a fantasy land where they take 1-2 just to say that they are in school. One girl that worked under me was always doing homework on her breaks, fast forward to 7-8 years later and she is still \"in school.\" For some it is a status symbol, for some it makes them feel more important, and for some it makes them have hope that they will have a better job one day. The real reason they never leave the world of retail is that they usually have job security and are scared of change.\r\n\r\n The trick is persistence and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. There is an old saying about growth only happens outside of your comfort zone. When we push ourselves to do something that makes us feel uncomfortable then we begin to understand our selves. When I first became a manager I wasn't sure of how to tell people what to do and was afraid of what people thought of me. The truth is that you always want people to like you, you just learn to be comfortable with telling people they are wrong. When you force yourself to confront an individual and solve a problem then you learn to better communicate your needs as well as that of the company. This mindset is something that is learned through experience. Some of the meanest managers I knew started out as push overs. Pushing yourself to grow in new ways is how you escape the retail hell by learning how to assimilate into a world outside of selling and stocking.\r\n \r\n### Existential Dread \r\n\r\nIf you look, you will find an abundance of escapism in the realm of retail workers. There is no shortage of existential dread for those in a dead end job. The question then becomes, does the job create the dread or are people that are lost and broken drawn to retail through a lack of ambition? The reality is a mix of both. Those that are lost or broken need to survive, the basis for which in our society is through monetary gains. The simplest for of which is through trading our time and energy for the ability to feed and shelter ourselves. The life that is then created is one of need. \r\n\r\nAccording to Maslow, we have a hierarchy of needs. Starting with our physiological needs, we have a duty to ourselves to fulfill those needs. Once we have adequately met the need for food, water, air, shelter, and anything else physical then we can move up the hierarchy of needs. The problem is that shelter is becoming increasingly difficult to procure on the retail salary. If one is in a constant state or worry about their physical needs, such as being able to eat or having a place to stay, then they cannot grow as a person or fulfill their other needs.\r\n\r\nThe next level of need we posses is that of safety. Once again, on a retail salary it can be difficult to obtain safety both through living arrangements and through that of our health care. America is especially known for having a horrendously expensive medical system. The truth is many have to face the choice of having a doctor's appointment or eating, and usually the baser need prevails. The mandated health insurance in America is a joke that only the rich laugh at. It provides a new burden to the working class in the form of hundreds of dollars a month that they do not have to spare while providing little to no benefit in terms of health care. A doctor's visit is still expensive enough to bankrupt most workers for a month and often health is neglected as the $300 visit may mean not being able to make ends meet. It's crazy how that little amount of money can make such a huge difference, and yet we are expected to pay that much to a company that only provides a security theater to our health.\r\n\r\nThe next need is love and belonging. Having all of the previous needs met means that we can focus our attentions on love and affection towards family and friends. This is often in a higher regard than the other needs, ie. the person that is more worried about getting lucky than their own safety and well-being. Most retail centers will have their fair share of secret lovers and intimate encounters. The same can be said of any social environment really. College, parties, and work are places where people are grouped together, either willingly or not, and are placed where connections are formed. This can be though shared suffering in the form of finals or working too many hours. It can also be through celebrations such as the end of finals, vacation, promotion, or whatever a party might be about. This creates an environment for us to fulfill our social needs and focus on something other than supporting ourselves. \r\n\r\nWhile some might argue that social interaction is over rated, it is an important part of existence, especially in retail. The next part of the hierarchy is esteem, something that often eludes those in retail. The esteem category includes our status in society, respect from others, recognition, and freedom. If you work a job that barely affords you a sense of physical security then chances are you don't feel free but are rather a wage slave. Working becomes a necessity and being able to change jobs, location, or schedules is not a luxury of this field. \r\n\r\nIn my tenure working retail I have amassed many horror stories of rude, angry, and degrading customers. People that make themselves feel better through making others miserable are abundant. They live for being rude and degrading to retail workers. Not a day goes by in which a retail worker doesn't have to deal with a rude customer and depending on their place of employment it can often be many rude customers a day. People treat you as if you are an imbecile for working to survive. They feel like retail is only for people that are inferior and that they should let those workers know just how pathetic they are. Respect is not only not given, but it is taken away from workers from the customers as well as the companies they serve. The low wages, the lying managers, and the pizza party instead of an actual incentives are just a few examples of how we are insulted by the company. For those retail workers that make it this far up the hierarchy, the esteem category is often one that will go unfulfilled. \r\n\r\nSelf-actualization is the capstone of the hierarchical pyramid. The desire to become a better person is often something with unfulfilled needs cannot achieve. This is the killer part of the existential dread. The fact is that you will not feel fulfilled unless you come to terms with your life and accept it as is. having your needs met is a great way to do this but working retail makes that in and of itself a challenge. It takes great mental prowess to overcome the other needs and feel like you are enough. Enough for your own life, enough for others to love, enough for anything. The sad truth is that most will never realize self actualization and in term spend their reality in a sense of unmotivated insufficiency. Others may spend their lives in a sense of delirium, choosing to ignore the fact that they are living paycheck to paycheck and ignoring other needs completely in the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Anecdotal Evidence\r\n\r\nThis is the part in which I share some of my personal experiences within my retail career. I share interactions, communications, and how they made me feel. This is not meant to discourage anyone from working retail but instead to shine a light on how they worker's are treated. I will share both positive and negative interactions with customers, management, and associates.\r\n\r\n### Fights Overnight\r\n\r\nThe first week overnight in one of the Wilmington stores I saw 3 homeless fights, a drug overdose, and an employee fight nearly happen. Having worked overnight before in previous stores I wasn't worried until I noticed how \"ghetto\" the store I was working in was. The first day there I parked next to a car with a person hanging out the driver's door. I addumed they were passed out asleep. When I went on lunch I noticed an ambulance taking them away. I felt responsible for a while until I realized that I didn't even consider they had OD'd. They had seemed unconscious but I have seen countless people sleep on the streets like that downtown. To me, they seemed asleep, passed out as if one had cunsumed too much the night before. I saw no syringe, or signs of drugs from what I saw but I felt bad none the less. \r\n\r\nThe first night there I saw a couple of homeless people fighting over beer thay they were drinking by the bathrooms. I had heard the manager that was showing me around start yelling while I was in the back and quickly ran to where he was. It turns out that there was two men arguing about something silly and throwing cans of beer as well as fists. As I arrived the other manager had broken them up long enough for the one homeless man to say \"he started it!\" I said something along the lines of \"I don't care who started it! You can't drink in the store, and you're making a mess and you have to leave.\" The one said \"I bought this beer and I have a reciept.\" In hindsight he probably just found a receipt int he parking lot and grabbed the same beer. I said something like \"I don't care, you've already destroyed half of it, just get out of here.\" \r\n\r\nI proceeded to see homeless fights, shoplifters, and recieved the occaisional death threat until something crazy happened. A little something called covid 19. They told me that they were going to shut down parts of the store and I thought they were crazy. They told me to wear a mask and contiue working like normal. Do the same amount of work while also doing temperature checks and shutting down the store. The upside to closing is that there were no homeless fights, no strippers coming in for the workers to get distracted by, and no one to mess up the store while we recovered from the mess we were left from the day crew. \r\n\r\n### Truck Loads of Fun\r\n\r\nWhen I was at UNCW I worked unloading trucks at Walmart. I have personally seen quite a few people get hurt while unloading trucks. I saw one person get hit in the head with a cast iron candle that someeone thought would be goot to put at the top of a rather unstable and large stack of boxes. As soon as he touched the one the candle came down from nearly 10 feet in the air and smacked him right in the side of the head. He immediately clutched his head and ran writhed in pain. Luckily it hit someone with a rather thick skull and he was alright but the way these trucks are loaded is not only dangerous, but idiotic at times. \r\n\r\nOne fun time I saw a pallet of water sitting on top of a pallet of TV's. I've seen crushed produce, whole pallets of dairy turned over and countless crushed boxes from carelessness in the wharehouse or through transit. Th half wrapped pallets and unsecured loads make tricky unloads. The already turned over egg and dairy pallets make for a slippery mess while also burning extra time cleaning up the mess, unloading, and through claiming out the damages. \r\n\r\nThere was one point, during the summer, where the trucks were so hot that even the candles would melt. I stuck my head in a melted candle once. If you have never experienced this kind of heat, then it is quite exhousting to work in, especially while constantly lifting upwards of 50 lbs.\r\n\r\nAt one point the unloader's job was to unload the GM truck, sort breakpacks ( mixed up boxes of freight ), unload and sort the grocery truck, and to pull everything out to the sales floor. There was a time in which I was the only person that showed up to work on 2nd shift IMS (The unload crew). As the only person it is impossible to unload 2000 pieces by yourself and do everything else in a day. With a team of sales associates I unloaded the truck, pulled and sorted the grocery truck by aisle, and sorted the breakpacks. All with time to spare. This was a feat that my older self probably couldn't, or at least wouldn't do. I then proceeded to deop a pallet on my foot while cleaning up and smash the end of my toe. With a bloody foot, I hobbled into the AD office and asked for a band aid. The Manager on duty looked at me and said \"ew gross. Don't get blood everywhere.\" There was no \"great job getting everything sorted\" and no \"Oh meh god, are you alright?!?!\" Instead I was just told I could leave early. Basically I had woked myself to death just to loose out on money from leaving early. What a deal. I wasn't told to fill out an incident report and I was just told to not bleed everywhere. He had even asked me if I could pull everything out to the floor with a bloody foot. This was the thanks for overachievement. \r\n\r\n### Thieving Coworkers\r\n\r\nI worked with a guy that would buy a drink at the register in electronics and say he already got the rest of the snacks he had, just to steal them and eat what wasn't his. \r\n\r\nI worked with a guy that would drink chocolate milk inside the dairy cooler and then place the empty cartons in the claims area. When management found out she had told him just don't do it anymore. He told her his family was hungry and that they weren't eating properly. This was a lie since he lived with his girlfriend's parents, who made sure their daughter and her baby were fed. This guy was also quite large for someone that would have been starving, and also brought a lunch every day. He then proceeded to steal steaks, yogurt, and drinks just for the sake of doing so. This went on until he finally quit to move to another state. \r\n\r\nOne set of cousines managed to steal thousands in electronics by sneaking it through the edge of the truck. They would go around and scoop up the dropped iPhones and iPads. They would talk about needing a new laptop and joke while dropping it through the hole. This went on for a while with the store knowing. All high ticket items are checked for on the trucks now to prevent this from happeneing. \r\n\r\nWherever there is commerce there is sure to be bad actors. \r\n\r\n### Lack of work ethics\r\n\r\nIn any position you will have people that do more and less than the average worker. This is just a fact of life. Not everyone performs at the same rate, yet they can get paid at the same rate. One of the most infuriating things is working hard to get something done just to be rewarded with more work than your co-workers. When you spend an entire day sweating just to see someone that makes more than you walk around and chat all day, it's beyond annoying. Every store will have your typical talker's that wonder around and BS all day. It's just a fact of retail. \r\n\r\nI once worked in a store that had a manager that would sleep while working overnight. He was an obese man that would exaggerate any achievement he had overnight while always talking down any other manager. He would act as if he could run any part of the store better than anyone else. My first night overnight, covering his vacation, I was told I did better than he ever did. When they told me I had to go overnight I was in a panic. I was affraid of failing. What I did was ask the people I knew did overnight well how they did it. I would also talk to all of the workers and see what they needed to get the job done. I prioritized what I knew the store manager looked for, since I toured with him many mornings, and I made sure the store was clean when I was walked off. Little did I know I would be walked off by the meanest and most senor ASM we had. Even though we were the same position her word was gold to the store manager. \r\n\r\nShe walked up and down most of the aisles in grocery, searching for any mistakes. Chekced the backroom looking for unworked freight and any messes. She couldn't find a thing. For the first time she actually gave me a compliment and said good job. When she told me that I did better than she ever saw the other guy do I was escstatic. But at the same time, the other manager that sucked and talked himself up made more than me. I had been screwed on my yearly raise by lying managers that were like a bunch of snakes, slowly strangling the life out of me. Now don't get me wrong, I got along with most of the team. That's why it hurt more when they stabbed me in the back by going out of their way to make me look bad while they themselves were horrible at their jobs. When the store manager doesn't leave the office and instead listens to a couple of snakes instead of the associates, you tend to get screwed. \r\n\r\nAfter proving my worth at that store I would often get punished with special assignments. As well as having to manage the backroom, grocery and consumables, I would also have to set up the store map and locations, plan and execute black fiday \"event\" day, and also close most of the time by myself.\r\n\r\n### Rude customers\r\n\r\nI worked in the garden center one summer and had an angry old man tell me that the plant's were dry. I said \"ok, we have someone that is watering them now.\" For some unknown reason the man said \"what are you gonna do, piss on them?\" My reaction was to say \"if that's what you want me to do.\" To this day I have no idea what that old prick wanted. Perhaps all he wanted was to argue with a low paid worker, maybe he wanted to feel important with his enlightened conclusion of the plant being dry, or most likely he wanted to get plants at a discount when they were absolutely fine. This is not out of the ordinary for a retail worker.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite things that customers do is threaten to go to the competition or stop shopping at XYZ big box store because of some minor inconveinience. This is hilarious to me since my paycheck will stay the same regardless. Most retail associates don't make commision, they don't get sales based incentives, and they are usually too overworked and underpaid to care. \r\n\r\nWorking at Lowes' lumber department you might get someone that wants a piece of plywood cut into precise dimensions a dozen different ways. When you inform them of the store policy of 2 cuts per board you get one of two reactions; understanding, or them trying to reason with you either through inferior logic or angry rants. These latter people will often threaten to go to Home Depot. Curiously enough, this is the same thing people will say if you don't carry whatever obscure piece of wood that they want. They thruth is that this is a meaningless threat to someone that isn't paid enough to afford their basic necessities, let alone pay any mind to these silly gestures. \r\n\r\nI had an elderly man try to buy a gun one time. He had trouble entering his information in the computer to fill out the proper 4473 form. I told him repeatedly that I couldn't fill the form out for him without a 3rd party witness, and since I was the only manager at the time I couldn't have another sign off on me inputing his answers for him. This was a perk of being short staffed. I needed my sporting goods associate to verify the form and for myself to sign off on the transaction, thus I could not be involved in the filling out of the form. I spent 45 minutes explaining how the computer worked and showing him how to type in his answers. I helped him get back up to where he was but in his frustrations he continued to berate me and tell me that I \"must not want to make the sale\" and that \"the other store's would have filled it out.\" After I explained the law again, he told me to \"take that gun, shove it up your ass, and pull the triger.\" I finally broke and told him I wouldn't do the sale. I told him I was refusing him due to his attitude and the fact that he clearly was unstable. I later found this man in electronics yelling at one of my workers and asking for their name. I intervened and told hime \"she doesn't have to give you her last name.\" He asked for my badge number, which is hilarious since we aren't cops, and I told him to leave. He asked for my full name and where I lived, to which I gave it to him. Telling him if he wanted to drive the 70 miles to see me he could. Literally 2 days later the man came in the store and apologized to me for being an asshole. This was a coutesy that most won't extend.\r\n\r\nEven though I try to approach everyone with respect, there are always customer that will degrade you to make themselves feel better. \r\n\r\nOne man and his wife had asked if we had samples of trex they could take home. I informed them that the samples where in a box and we weren't allowed to give them away, espescially since we wouldn't be able to show anyone else that color without ordering an entire new box and waiting on it to come in. This answer wasn't good enough for this smug old yankee. He quickly said \"oh what is Lowes hurting for money? Should I just reach in my pocket and give them something? You guys look tired and like you don't even want to be here.\" This part was true as I had been working for 7 hours with out as much as a bathroom break at that point. \r\n\r\nHe then said \"you look unmotivated. What, they don't pay you enough to be motivated?\" Bear in mind that this is just because I wouldn't let him take part of a sample box that clearly said \"Don't give away or you will break the set\" in sharpie, right on the box. He had a smile but a degrading tone, a shit eater's grin, and a nasty attitude literally over me saying \"we aren't suppose to give them out.\" This is even after I had offered to show them the samples. They had attempted to belittle my coworker who was driving the forklift and me who was spotting him as they had stopped us to ask their idiotic question. They instantly went into anger from the thought of not getting their way. These are the people that live in St James NC. \r\n\r\nBeing the humble person I am, I appologized for the inconvenience but he wasn't having it. He wasn't satisfied that he had stopped us from filling the lumber, or that he had his question answered. No he just wanted to feel superior to someone. To show that he had money and to degrade a reatail worker to attempt a cure at his impotence.  \r\n\r\n## Thoughts on Retail work\r\n\r\nThe point of this, as unbelievable as it is, was not to dissuade anyone from working retail. I did so for many years and had some good times in the process. You will meet some crazy people from all walks of life and you will learn a lot in the process. These lessons learned are that of life experience. Retail is also a good transitionary job for those looking switch careers. It can also help you live while going to school. The tough part is either working too hard, through work ethic or a ban manager, and not having the energy to leave this field, or having to work 40 hours to afford to live a basic existence. The exchange of time for money can leave you burned our when attempting to study for a better career at the same time. Providing 8 hours of sleep a night and a 9 hour work day, including the unpaid lunch, you are only left 7 hours in the day for everything else. This means less than 7 hours to get ready for work, commute, clean the house, clean yourself, and anything recreational. Realistically, youget maybe 2-3 hours a day of time you can study or work on a new career with out taking away from the other hours of the day. For instance, if you get less than 8 hours of sleep then you can study or go to school before work. This is a part of why many fall into the retail trap.","src/content/blog/lifestyle/retail.md","964462597473786e",{html:165,metadata:166},"<p>Table of Contents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#whats-the-point\">What’s the point</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#barrier-to-entry\">Barrier to Entry</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#abundance-of-options\">Abundance of options</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#trying-to-escape-the-world-of-retail\">Escape</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#existential-dread\">Exisitnetial dread</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-point\">What’s the point?</h2>\n<p>For millions of Americans working retail is a reality that they can’t escape. Over the last decade I have worked in retail, from stocker to management, and have met people from just about every walk of life. From business owners to former IT workers, people from different backgrounds flock to retail positions. The real question is why, what are the benefits, downfalls, and is it for you?</p>\n<p>I just want to start by saying that retail workers are an essential part of our economy. Without people to stock shelves, run registers, clean, and everything in between, there would be no commerce. That being said the retail worker is considered one of the lowest forms of employee. Why is this? Is it the barrier to entry for these positions? Is it the abundance of people that will work the position? Is it the lack of skill required for the position? Perhaps it is a mix of these things that keeps the retail worker in the shadows.</p>\n<p>The point of this post is to explain the pros, cons, and some examples of retail work. This isn’t designed to sway your opinion for or against retail postitions, but instead to share some experiences. The astute of you will probably be able to determine my views on the subject, but that is niether here nor there. This is just a way of sharing some of my personal experience from over 10 years of retail work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"barrier-to-entry\">Barrier to entry</h3>\n<p>With the low barrier to entry anyone can apply and get a job in the field. There is literally a job for anyone. Can’t run a register, you can probably push a broom around. Can’t push a broom, you can probably check receipts or spot people with equipment. Can’t deal with people, there’s always the accounting/cash side of things. In my tenure I have worked with many disabled people that were able to work and provide value to the overall store. You can think of working at a big retailer like community college. The barrier to entry is low enough that just about anyone can get in, while there are still some people that get rejected.</p>\n<p>Who gets rejected? The unfair bit of retail is the drug testing. People fail them all of the time. It is ultimately unfair to judge someone based on how they spend their free time. If someone were to apply for a position at a grocery store after their trip to Colorado then they could easily fail a drug test for something that is legal in another state. Controversial take, many people can trick drug tests so you only weed out the honest drug users. That being said you don’t stop the crafty ones that are willing to lie and cheat to get a job.</p>\n<p>What about background checks? Those also pose a risk for potential employees. Most companies require a background check for felonies and sometimes even credit scores. This is supposed to weed out the dangerous people or those that might steal. This is just another way or biasing the system. There are plenty of nonviolent, non-theft related felonies, and as always this archaic system doesn’t leave room for interpretation. Some places even require a credit check to show if someone is in debt. The though behind that is that those in debt are more willing to steal. Realistically speaking, if someone is going to steal, then they probably wouldn’t be in debt in the first place. This is more of a way of sifting out the “undesirables” than a real measure of security. With most things, this should be left up to manager’s discretion; however, most retail chains don’t even trust their management teams.</p>\n<h3 id=\"abundance-of-options\">Abundance of options</h3>\n<p>As a former hiring manager, I have first hand experience pulling from the application pool. Believe me when I say there was no real shortage of applicants. There may have been times in which we had more or less depending on the season but there was usually someone to call in for an interview. Qualification on the other hand was the problem. If I want to hire a supervisor and no one internal is qualified, then it might be a struggle to find an external hire to fill the position. That being said, the labor shortage is a more of a political buzzword than a reality.</p>\n<p>Yes there may have been a shallower applicant pool during the pandemic, but generally speaking applicants are abundant when the pay and position is reasonable. Talk to HR and hiring manager and you’ll find out that when the economy got tighter so did the hiring pool. I’ve seen job postings for software developers where the posting would collect 900 applications in 24 hours. How can there be a shortage of applicants for retail when there is such an abundance of developers? Pay and benefits. No one wants to work themselves to death for minimum wage. This isn’t a labor shortage, this is a pay shortage. Working 40 hours a week for $7.25 an hour is less than $1200 a month. That wont even cover rent for most people. If there is a low number of applicants it is up to the company to adjust starting pay and benefits to make the position more enticing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"benefits\">Benefits</h3>\n<p>There are a few benefits to working in retail. There is the low barrier to entry and the plethora of jobs. The fact that you don’t need to have a formal education or a certain amount of experience means that just about anyone cane get a job. See the earlier section for the pitfalls. The abundance of jobs means that you can grab a job and work while getting into the field of your choice. Sometimes, at higher levels, the money is actually decent. For example, a Walmart store manager can start at $125,000 with the potential of a bonus that is 125% of that. I have personally seen store managers make $90,000 bonuses. That being said, you can also expect to spend the majority of your time and energy on the store.</p>\n<p>One of the other main benefits is that you can learn on the job. Learning how to merchandise, increase sales, and properly service customers are skills that will carry over to any other field. Some places even have academies to send their management teams. While these skills might not be the best on a resume, they can carry over from company to company. Inventory control is essential to managing inventory flow, merchandising teaches visual styling, and customer service is a universal skill when in a front facing environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-escape-the-world-of-retail\">Trying to escape the world of retail</h2>\n<p>There exists a problem in which people start a retail job and then give up on their dreams. If anything it is a common joke among retail workers. People grab a job and then settle into that job. The problem is that the either exert all of their energy in that job or get too comfortable and stop looking for something better.</p>\n<p>So what is the solution? Keep working on you skills in the field that you want to learn. Want to be a web developer? Keep making web sites. Want to work in IT? Study for the A+ or keep applying to entry level roles.</p>\n<p>have personally seen many people leave retail for a new career. I worked with someone that unloaded trucks and stocked. He went to school at the same time and later got a job as a diesel mechanic. This was a rare case in retail. I’m not saying that people can’t escape the void of retail, but it isn’t that common. Most of the people you see “going to school” live in a fantasy land where they take 1-2 just to say that they are in school. One girl that worked under me was always doing homework on her breaks, fast forward to 7-8 years later and she is still “in school.” For some it is a status symbol, for some it makes them feel more important, and for some it makes them have hope that they will have a better job one day. The real reason they never leave the world of retail is that they usually have job security and are scared of change.</p>\n<p>The trick is persistence and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. There is an old saying about growth only happens outside of your comfort zone. When we push ourselves to do something that makes us feel uncomfortable then we begin to understand our selves. When I first became a manager I wasn’t sure of how to tell people what to do and was afraid of what people thought of me. The truth is that you always want people to like you, you just learn to be comfortable with telling people they are wrong. When you force yourself to confront an individual and solve a problem then you learn to better communicate your needs as well as that of the company. This mindset is something that is learned through experience. Some of the meanest managers I knew started out as push overs. Pushing yourself to grow in new ways is how you escape the retail hell by learning how to assimilate into a world outside of selling and stocking.</p>\n<h3 id=\"existential-dread\">Existential Dread</h3>\n<p>If you look, you will find an abundance of escapism in the realm of retail workers. There is no shortage of existential dread for those in a dead end job. The question then becomes, does the job create the dread or are people that are lost and broken drawn to retail through a lack of ambition? The reality is a mix of both. Those that are lost or broken need to survive, the basis for which in our society is through monetary gains. The simplest for of which is through trading our time and energy for the ability to feed and shelter ourselves. The life that is then created is one of need.</p>\n<p>According to Maslow, we have a hierarchy of needs. Starting with our physiological needs, we have a duty to ourselves to fulfill those needs. Once we have adequately met the need for food, water, air, shelter, and anything else physical then we can move up the hierarchy of needs. The problem is that shelter is becoming increasingly difficult to procure on the retail salary. If one is in a constant state or worry about their physical needs, such as being able to eat or having a place to stay, then they cannot grow as a person or fulfill their other needs.</p>\n<p>The next level of need we posses is that of safety. Once again, on a retail salary it can be difficult to obtain safety both through living arrangements and through that of our health care. America is especially known for having a horrendously expensive medical system. The truth is many have to face the choice of having a doctor’s appointment or eating, and usually the baser need prevails. The mandated health insurance in America is a joke that only the rich laugh at. It provides a new burden to the working class in the form of hundreds of dollars a month that they do not have to spare while providing little to no benefit in terms of health care. A doctor’s visit is still expensive enough to bankrupt most workers for a month and often health is neglected as the $300 visit may mean not being able to make ends meet. It’s crazy how that little amount of money can make such a huge difference, and yet we are expected to pay that much to a company that only provides a security theater to our health.</p>\n<p>The next need is love and belonging. Having all of the previous needs met means that we can focus our attentions on love and affection towards family and friends. This is often in a higher regard than the other needs, ie. the person that is more worried about getting lucky than their own safety and well-being. Most retail centers will have their fair share of secret lovers and intimate encounters. The same can be said of any social environment really. College, parties, and work are places where people are grouped together, either willingly or not, and are placed where connections are formed. This can be though shared suffering in the form of finals or working too many hours. It can also be through celebrations such as the end of finals, vacation, promotion, or whatever a party might be about. This creates an environment for us to fulfill our social needs and focus on something other than supporting ourselves.</p>\n<p>While some might argue that social interaction is over rated, it is an important part of existence, especially in retail. The next part of the hierarchy is esteem, something that often eludes those in retail. The esteem category includes our status in society, respect from others, recognition, and freedom. If you work a job that barely affords you a sense of physical security then chances are you don’t feel free but are rather a wage slave. Working becomes a necessity and being able to change jobs, location, or schedules is not a luxury of this field.</p>\n<p>In my tenure working retail I have amassed many horror stories of rude, angry, and degrading customers. People that make themselves feel better through making others miserable are abundant. They live for being rude and degrading to retail workers. Not a day goes by in which a retail worker doesn’t have to deal with a rude customer and depending on their place of employment it can often be many rude customers a day. People treat you as if you are an imbecile for working to survive. They feel like retail is only for people that are inferior and that they should let those workers know just how pathetic they are. Respect is not only not given, but it is taken away from workers from the customers as well as the companies they serve. The low wages, the lying managers, and the pizza party instead of an actual incentives are just a few examples of how we are insulted by the company. For those retail workers that make it this far up the hierarchy, the esteem category is often one that will go unfulfilled.</p>\n<p>Self-actualization is the capstone of the hierarchical pyramid. The desire to become a better person is often something with unfulfilled needs cannot achieve. This is the killer part of the existential dread. The fact is that you will not feel fulfilled unless you come to terms with your life and accept it as is. having your needs met is a great way to do this but working retail makes that in and of itself a challenge. It takes great mental prowess to overcome the other needs and feel like you are enough. Enough for your own life, enough for others to love, enough for anything. The sad truth is that most will never realize self actualization and in term spend their reality in a sense of unmotivated insufficiency. Others may spend their lives in a sense of delirium, choosing to ignore the fact that they are living paycheck to paycheck and ignoring other needs completely in the pursuit of happiness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anecdotal-evidence\">Anecdotal Evidence</h2>\n<p>This is the part in which I share some of my personal experiences within my retail career. I share interactions, communications, and how they made me feel. This is not meant to discourage anyone from working retail but instead to shine a light on how they worker’s are treated. I will share both positive and negative interactions with customers, management, and associates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fights-overnight\">Fights Overnight</h3>\n<p>The first week overnight in one of the Wilmington stores I saw 3 homeless fights, a drug overdose, and an employee fight nearly happen. Having worked overnight before in previous stores I wasn’t worried until I noticed how “ghetto” the store I was working in was. The first day there I parked next to a car with a person hanging out the driver’s door. I addumed they were passed out asleep. When I went on lunch I noticed an ambulance taking them away. I felt responsible for a while until I realized that I didn’t even consider they had OD’d. They had seemed unconscious but I have seen countless people sleep on the streets like that downtown. To me, they seemed asleep, passed out as if one had cunsumed too much the night before. I saw no syringe, or signs of drugs from what I saw but I felt bad none the less.</p>\n<p>The first night there I saw a couple of homeless people fighting over beer thay they were drinking by the bathrooms. I had heard the manager that was showing me around start yelling while I was in the back and quickly ran to where he was. It turns out that there was two men arguing about something silly and throwing cans of beer as well as fists. As I arrived the other manager had broken them up long enough for the one homeless man to say “he started it!” I said something along the lines of “I don’t care who started it! You can’t drink in the store, and you’re making a mess and you have to leave.” The one said “I bought this beer and I have a reciept.” In hindsight he probably just found a receipt int he parking lot and grabbed the same beer. I said something like “I don’t care, you’ve already destroyed half of it, just get out of here.”</p>\n<p>I proceeded to see homeless fights, shoplifters, and recieved the occaisional death threat until something crazy happened. A little something called covid 19. They told me that they were going to shut down parts of the store and I thought they were crazy. They told me to wear a mask and contiue working like normal. Do the same amount of work while also doing temperature checks and shutting down the store. The upside to closing is that there were no homeless fights, no strippers coming in for the workers to get distracted by, and no one to mess up the store while we recovered from the mess we were left from the day crew.</p>\n<h3 id=\"truck-loads-of-fun\">Truck Loads of Fun</h3>\n<p>When I was at UNCW I worked unloading trucks at Walmart. I have personally seen quite a few people get hurt while unloading trucks. I saw one person get hit in the head with a cast iron candle that someeone thought would be goot to put at the top of a rather unstable and large stack of boxes. As soon as he touched the one the candle came down from nearly 10 feet in the air and smacked him right in the side of the head. He immediately clutched his head and ran writhed in pain. Luckily it hit someone with a rather thick skull and he was alright but the way these trucks are loaded is not only dangerous, but idiotic at times.</p>\n<p>One fun time I saw a pallet of water sitting on top of a pallet of TV’s. I’ve seen crushed produce, whole pallets of dairy turned over and countless crushed boxes from carelessness in the wharehouse or through transit. Th half wrapped pallets and unsecured loads make tricky unloads. The already turned over egg and dairy pallets make for a slippery mess while also burning extra time cleaning up the mess, unloading, and through claiming out the damages.</p>\n<p>There was one point, during the summer, where the trucks were so hot that even the candles would melt. I stuck my head in a melted candle once. If you have never experienced this kind of heat, then it is quite exhousting to work in, especially while constantly lifting upwards of 50 lbs.</p>\n<p>At one point the unloader’s job was to unload the GM truck, sort breakpacks ( mixed up boxes of freight ), unload and sort the grocery truck, and to pull everything out to the sales floor. There was a time in which I was the only person that showed up to work on 2nd shift IMS (The unload crew). As the only person it is impossible to unload 2000 pieces by yourself and do everything else in a day. With a team of sales associates I unloaded the truck, pulled and sorted the grocery truck by aisle, and sorted the breakpacks. All with time to spare. This was a feat that my older self probably couldn’t, or at least wouldn’t do. I then proceeded to deop a pallet on my foot while cleaning up and smash the end of my toe. With a bloody foot, I hobbled into the AD office and asked for a band aid. The Manager on duty looked at me and said “ew gross. Don’t get blood everywhere.” There was no “great job getting everything sorted” and no “Oh meh god, are you alright?!?!” Instead I was just told I could leave early. Basically I had woked myself to death just to loose out on money from leaving early. What a deal. I wasn’t told to fill out an incident report and I was just told to not bleed everywhere. He had even asked me if I could pull everything out to the floor with a bloody foot. This was the thanks for overachievement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thieving-coworkers\">Thieving Coworkers</h3>\n<p>I worked with a guy that would buy a drink at the register in electronics and say he already got the rest of the snacks he had, just to steal them and eat what wasn’t his.</p>\n<p>I worked with a guy that would drink chocolate milk inside the dairy cooler and then place the empty cartons in the claims area. When management found out she had told him just don’t do it anymore. He told her his family was hungry and that they weren’t eating properly. This was a lie since he lived with his girlfriend’s parents, who made sure their daughter and her baby were fed. This guy was also quite large for someone that would have been starving, and also brought a lunch every day. He then proceeded to steal steaks, yogurt, and drinks just for the sake of doing so. This went on until he finally quit to move to another state.</p>\n<p>One set of cousines managed to steal thousands in electronics by sneaking it through the edge of the truck. They would go around and scoop up the dropped iPhones and iPads. They would talk about needing a new laptop and joke while dropping it through the hole. This went on for a while with the store knowing. All high ticket items are checked for on the trucks now to prevent this from happeneing.</p>\n<p>Wherever there is commerce there is sure to be bad actors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lack-of-work-ethics\">Lack of work ethics</h3>\n<p>In any position you will have people that do more and less than the average worker. This is just a fact of life. Not everyone performs at the same rate, yet they can get paid at the same rate. One of the most infuriating things is working hard to get something done just to be rewarded with more work than your co-workers. When you spend an entire day sweating just to see someone that makes more than you walk around and chat all day, it’s beyond annoying. Every store will have your typical talker’s that wonder around and BS all day. It’s just a fact of retail.</p>\n<p>I once worked in a store that had a manager that would sleep while working overnight. He was an obese man that would exaggerate any achievement he had overnight while always talking down any other manager. He would act as if he could run any part of the store better than anyone else. My first night overnight, covering his vacation, I was told I did better than he ever did. When they told me I had to go overnight I was in a panic. I was affraid of failing. What I did was ask the people I knew did overnight well how they did it. I would also talk to all of the workers and see what they needed to get the job done. I prioritized what I knew the store manager looked for, since I toured with him many mornings, and I made sure the store was clean when I was walked off. Little did I know I would be walked off by the meanest and most senor ASM we had. Even though we were the same position her word was gold to the store manager.</p>\n<p>She walked up and down most of the aisles in grocery, searching for any mistakes. Chekced the backroom looking for unworked freight and any messes. She couldn’t find a thing. For the first time she actually gave me a compliment and said good job. When she told me that I did better than she ever saw the other guy do I was escstatic. But at the same time, the other manager that sucked and talked himself up made more than me. I had been screwed on my yearly raise by lying managers that were like a bunch of snakes, slowly strangling the life out of me. Now don’t get me wrong, I got along with most of the team. That’s why it hurt more when they stabbed me in the back by going out of their way to make me look bad while they themselves were horrible at their jobs. When the store manager doesn’t leave the office and instead listens to a couple of snakes instead of the associates, you tend to get screwed.</p>\n<p>After proving my worth at that store I would often get punished with special assignments. As well as having to manage the backroom, grocery and consumables, I would also have to set up the store map and locations, plan and execute black fiday “event” day, and also close most of the time by myself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rude-customers\">Rude customers</h3>\n<p>I worked in the garden center one summer and had an angry old man tell me that the plant’s were dry. I said “ok, we have someone that is watering them now.” For some unknown reason the man said “what are you gonna do, piss on them?” My reaction was to say “if that’s what you want me to do.” To this day I have no idea what that old prick wanted.

I told him repeatedly that I couldn’t fill the form out for him without a 3rd party witness, and since I was the only manager at the time I couldn’t have another sign off on me inputing his answers for him. This was a perk of being short staffed. I needed my sporting goods associate to verify the form and for myself to sign off on the transaction, thus I could not be involved in the filling out of the form. I spent 45 minutes explaining how the computer worked and showing him how to type in his answers. I helped him get back up to where he was but in his frustrations he continued to berate me and tell me that I “must not want to make the sale” and that “the other store’s would have filled it out.” After I explained the law again, he told me to “take that gun, shove it up your ass, and pull the triger.” I finally broke and told him I wouldn’t do the sale. I told him I was refusing him due to his attitude and the fact that he clearly was unstable. I later found this man in electronics yelling at one of my workers and asking for their name. I intervened and told hime “she doesn’t have to give you her last name.” He asked for my badge number, which is hilarious since we aren’t cops, and I told him to leave. He asked for my full name and where I lived, to which I gave it to him. Telling him if he wanted to drive the 70 miles to see me he could. Literally 2 days later the man came in the store and apologized to me for being an asshole. This was a coutesy that most won’t extend.</p>\n<p>Even though I try to approach everyone with respect, there are always customer that will degrade you to make themselves feel better.</p>\n<p>One man and his wife had asked if we had samples of trex they could take home. I informed them that the samples where in a box and we weren’t allowed to give them away, espescially since we wouldn’t be able to show anyone else that color without ordering an entire new box and waiting on it to come in. This answer wasn’t good enough for this smug old yankee. He quickly said “oh what is Lowes hurting for money? Should I just reach in my pocket and give them something? You guys look tired and like you don’t even want to be here.” This part was true as I had been working for 7 hours with out as much as a bathroom break at that point.</p>\n<p>He then said “you look unmotivated. What, they don’t pay you enough to be motivated?” Bear in mind that this is just because I wouldn’t let him take part of a sample box that clearly said “Don’t give away or you will break the set” in sharpie, right on the box. He had a smile but a degrading tone, a shit eater’s grin, and a nasty attitude literally over me saying “we aren’t suppose to give them out.” This is even after I had offered to show them the samples. They had attempted to belittle my coworker who was driving the forklift and me who was spotting him as they had stopped us to ask their idiotic question. They instantly went into anger from the thought of not getting their way. These are the people that live in St James NC.</p>\n<p>Being the humble person I am, I appologized for the inconvenience but he wasn’t having it. He wasn’t satisfied that he had stopped us from filling the lumber, or that he had his question answered. No he just wanted to feel superior to someone. To show that he had money and to degrade a reatail worker to attempt a cure at his impotence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts-on-retail-work\">Thoughts on Retail work</h2>\n<p>The point of this, as unbelievable as it is, was not to dissuade anyone from working retail. I did so for many years and had some good times in the process. You will meet some crazy people from all walks of life and you will learn a lot in the process. These lessons learned are that of life experience. Retail is also a good transitionary job for those looking switch careers. It can also help you live while going to school. The tough part is either working too hard, through work ethic or a ban manager, and not having the energy to leave this field, or having to work 40 hours to afford to live a basic existence. The exchange of time for money can leave you burned our when attempting to study for a better career at the same time. Providing 8 hours of sleep a night and a 9 hour work day, including the unpaid lunch, you are only left 7 hours in the day for everything else. This means less than 7 hours to get ready for work, commute, clean the house, clean yourself, and anything recreational. Realistically, youget maybe 2-3 hours a day of time you can study or work on a new career with out taking away from the other hours of the day. For instance, if you get less than 8 hours of sleep then you can study or go to school before work. This is a part of why many fall into the retail trap.</p>",{headings:167,localImagePaths:207,remoteImagePaths:208,frontmatter:209,imagePaths:210},[168,171,174,177,180,183,186,189,192,195,198,201,204],{depth:40,slug:169,text:170},"whats-the-point","What’s the point?",{depth:50,slug:172,text:173},"barrier-to-entry","Barrier to entry",{depth:50,slug:175,text:176},"abundance-of-options","Abundance of options",{depth:50,slug:178,text:179},"benefits","Benefits",{depth:40,slug:181,text:182},"trying-to-escape-the-world-of-retail","Trying to escape the world of retail",{depth:50,slug:184,text:185},"existential-dread","Existential Dread",{depth:40,slug:187,text:188},"anecdotal-evidence","Anecdotal Evidence",{depth:50,slug:190,text:191},"fights-overnight","Fights Overnight",{depth:50,slug:193,text:194},"truck-loads-of-fun","Truck Loads of Fun",{depth:50,slug:196,text:197},"thieving-coworkers","Thieving Coworkers",{depth:50,slug:199,text:200},"lack-of-work-ethics","Lack of work ethics",{depth:50,slug:202,text:203},"rude-customers","Rude customers",{depth:40,slug:205,text:206},"thoughts-on-retail-work","Thoughts on Retail work",[],[],{title:159,description:160,draft:23},[],"lifestyle/retail.md","past_commit",{id:212,data:214,body:220,filePath:221,digest:222,rendered:223,legacyId:235},{title:215,description:216,pubDate:217,draft:30,heroImage:218,category:219},"How to commit the past","How to make commits for different dates in the command line.

Writing is satisfying and it allows me to organize my thoughts. Writing it down helps me structure the information. It also makes me dive deeper into concepts than I normally would. Between these two things, heopefully I will retain information better, and maybe help others along the way. If not, then at least I will have a quick note I can reference later.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that blogs are short and easy. This isn't me writing a book on these topics. The goal is to make short, structured notes. The blog format is also ideal for writing opinion pieces, reviews, and short articles.\r\n\r\n## Formatting\r\n\r\nThis is going to be written in Markdown. I like the way it takes notes and it allows me to add structure to the notes with headings, tables, lists, blockquotes, links, images, and syntax highlighting. Markdown is also a common practice in writing blogs. It is easy to convert into html and is already structured. There are ton's of tutorials on creating your own blog site using different frameworks that all use markdown for the blog writing.\r\n\r\nThe basic structure shoudl be something like this:\r\n    \r\n    ---\r\n    \r\n    [title: The title]\r\n    [description   :    A short description of the blog         ]\r\n    [pubDate?      :    the initial publication date            ]\r\n    [updatedDate?  :    the date of any update                  ]\r\n    [draft?        :    'final' or anything else for draft      ]\r\n    [heroImage?    :    a link to the hero image for the blog   ]\r\n    \r\n    ---\r\n\r\n    [##section]\r\n        [###subsection]\r\n            [information for subsection]\r\n        [###subsection]\r\n            [information for subsection]\r\n        [###subsection]\r\n            [information for subsection]\r\n    [##section]\r\n        [###subsection]\r\n            [information for subsection]\r\n        ...\r\n\r\nEverything in between the iniitial sets of 3 dashes (---) is considered a frontmatter. This is formatting information that is then picked up by Astro and used as metadata for the blog post. The parts with question marks are optional.\r\n\r\nSeems basic, right? It all depends on the content. As they say, \"content is king.\"\r\nThere are a few things I'll try to stick to.\r\n\r\n- Try to include images for visual learners like myself\r\n- Syntax highlight when possible\r\n- Do the research - I'll try not to post or regurgitate BS\r\n- All technical information should able to be used as documentation\r\n\r\nThat being said, not all of this will be tech documents and tutorials. This will probably also have a section for reviews, commentary, and things I think are cool.\r\n\r\n=>>> This is a work in progress <<<=","src/content/blog/blogAbout/blogAbout.md","e0abf1153fc295b1",{html:246,metadata:247},"<h2 id=\"what-is-this\">What is this?</h2>\n<p>Have you ever looked something up only to realize that it’s something that you have looked up before?

There are ton’s of tutorials on creating your own blog site using different frameworks that all use markdown for the blog writing.</p>\n<p>The basic structure shoudl be something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>---</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[title: The title]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[description   :    A short description of the blog         ]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[pubDate?      :    the initial publication date            ]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[updatedDate?  :    the date of any update                  ]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[draft?        :    'final' or anything else for draft      ]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[heroImage?    :    a link to the hero image for the blog   ]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>---</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[##section]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    [###subsection]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        [information for subsection]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    [###subsection]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        [information for subsection]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    [###subsection]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        [information for subsection]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[##section]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    [###subsection]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        [information for subsection]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    ...</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Everything in between the iniitial sets of 3 dashes (---) is considered a frontmatter.

Actually --allowerasing isn't even mentioned in the DNF5 man page as it is on by default. \r\n\r\nThe man pages used to say this:\r\n```\r\n--allowerasing\r\n    Allow erasing of installed packages to resolve\r\n    dependencies. This option could be used as an alternative\r\n    to the yum swap command where packages to remove are not\r\n    explicitly defined.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso from the old man pages:\r\n```\r\ndnf [options] autoremove\r\n    Removes all packages from the system that were originally\r\n    installed as dependencies of user-installed packages, but\r\n    which are no longer required by any such package.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDNF5 has a few other new features I'll have to play around with since I made it to Fedora Server 41.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nAs stated, the process is simple if you have performed any package management in Fedora. \r\n\r\n1. Make sure your system is up to date with `sudo dnf --refresh upgrade`\r\n2. Use the dnf plugin to download the next version of fedora and get it ready for install with `sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever={version_you_want}`\r\n3. Install the new version with `sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot`\r\n\r\nIt's that simple. \r\n\r\nThe reason I didn't include installing the system-upgrade pluging for dnf is that it is a one and done type of deal. \r\nOnce you install it you have it into your future versions.\r\nIt is also included in DNF5 so you won't need to install it in the future. \r\nIf however you have one of those old copies of fedora and you need to install it just try `sudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade\r\n`\r\n\r\nI don't want to understate how long of a process this is. Doing version upgrades will take time and require rebooting. \r\nThis took me nearly all day, although I would often walk away and do another upgrade when I remembered. \r\n\r\nI did this completely through SSH which made it hard to tell when the server was back up and ready to reconnect. \r\nIf you are doing this on the desktop version of Fedora, aka Fedora Workstationm, then you can easily use the GUI to perform the system update. \r\nI, however, prefer the feel, speed, and responsiveness of doing this through the terminal.\r\nYou get more information about what is going on and you have more control over the entire process.\r\n\r\nThe drawback of doing this though SSH is that I didn't notice that my screen was frozen on \"booting Fedora 41\" since I wasn't physically using the machine. A little troubleshooting of nVidia drivers will fix that though, hopefully.","src/content/blog/lifestyle/serverUpdates.md","ec8e64e134aec025",{html:275,metadata:276},"<h2 id=\"introductions\">Introductions</h2>\n<p>As the data hoarder I am, I have a server that I use for my files and backups.

I found myself several times over watching something on a streaming service instead of just standing up and finding the DVD or BLURAY that I own. But when the benefits of convienience is taken away what are we left with? A costly bill of services unused, sometimes for months on end.\r\n\r\nI used to run XBMC and later KODI on my media PC and I even had it connected to my file server at one time. Over the years however, I have fellen prey to the smart-tv/streaming service trap. Netflix, Hulu, HBO max, Amazon, and Disney+ were all active on my TV. Having seen that I only watch a few services, and mostly for shows and movies I already own, I decided it was time to downsize. My roommate got the ad-tier of Netflix after I cancelled for their korean dramas and as it turned out we both had Hulu as they had a Disney+ subscription. I cancelled the HBO/Hulu subscription as I only really used it for The Last of Us and old movies. Also Hulu originals went down hill after they were acquired by the big D. Using my many shelves and boxes of Vinyls's, CD's, DVDs, Blu-rays, and even old VHSs it was time to use the backup's I had once made and work on the new material I gained during the lazy times of the golden age of streaming. For legal reasons I won't advocate for piracy eventhough many streamers, including LTT, may say they use it to aqcuire their \"digital backups\" of the media they own. I don't want to debate that and will just say this is for your media files. I will also not go into detail on how to rip or backup media here as this is more about the streaming of personal files and not of their aqcuisition. I have spent many a black friday buying whole series of TV shows and collecting movies on sale.\r\n\r\n## File server\r\n\r\nLike many nerds, I have a file server for my backups and to store copies of my pictures, movies, and tv shows. I even keep copies of my ebooks and games so I hopefully don't lose anything. Shoot, I even have copies of my old college work from my CS classes.\r\n\r\nThe server is an old 8 core processor that can keep up with a few VMs and a server version of Fedora.\r\nThe GPU in the server is a 980ti Hybrid. A water cooled beast of a graphics card when it was new. Now unfortunately it's 5 generations too old to be useful. It sucks at x265 and x264 transcoding, it doesn't support AV1 or HEVC transcode, and it suffers from a bad case of NVIDIA drivers being garbage on linux. Thanks Jensen Huang. <br>\r\nEven the most basic of Intel CPUs can do these things nowadays but, who has money for upgrades in times like these?\r\nThe first upgrade I need is more large drives to fill out some zpools. A topic for another time...\r\n\r\nI can easily install a media server in either docker or directly on the system since I am t he only one using it.\r\nThe question is which one?\r\n\r\nI know I want the following things:\r\n- UPnP support - so my smart TV picks it up with no fuss\r\n- A web interface - so I can watch from other computers\r\n- Basic transcoding abilities - not all formats play on all devices\r\n- For it to recognize basic metadata - even if I have to add it in a separate file\r\n\r\nWith the rise of people complaining about plex and the point being to freely watch my own content, I also what it to be free and open source if possible.\r\n\r\n## Jellyfin?\r\n\r\nHaving seen the power of jellyfin a few years back I decided to run it on my fileserver. It worked pretty well when I tried it on windows and it did a fair job of figuring out what my media was. The problem? My file server runs linux and, while I have heard of people having good luck running Jellyfin on linux, I have not. I only have bout 7 TB in my desktop and, while that sounds like a enough to serve some media, most of my space is taken up by steam games and projects.\r\nThis is why it is crucial to run it on my server.\r\n\r\n## Jellyfin is great, until it isn't\r\n\r\nAnyways, long story long, I have problems running Jellyfin on my file server. Jellyfin recognizes the folder and will show the files when I'm in the folder mode, but it refuses to find metadata and recognize the media enough to sort it into the appropriate library. I ruled out permissions issues and configuration issues through days of troubleshooting. I even went as far as to use TinyMediaManager to rename and manually find metadata for serveral of the files. You would think with the shows and movies being recognized my TinyMediaManager, the files/folders being renamed, and the metadata being saved, that Jellyfin would quickly recognize the media right?\r\n\r\nApparantly not.\r\n\r\nIt will sometimes recognize the media as it will show episodes of TV shows in the \"suggested\" or \"newly added\" sections but it doesn't show in the actual \"shows\" section. Sometimes I can get Jellyfin to find and recognize shows just to not play anything claiming there was no playable media found. Thinking this could be transcode issues I made sure the files would play fine through a vlc stream. \r\n\r\nThat being, said I also know my TV can directly play some of these files from flash drives.\r\nWhy can't Jellyfin just serve up these files directly without transcode issues or recognition issues?\r\n\r\nAfter days of changing permissions, renaming files, making nfo files for the metadata using tinyMediaManager, and even completely removing the program and reinstalling I still had the same issues. The documentation always shows how to do things on debian. Is the problem that I am using Fedora?\r\n\r\nI asked my brother if he had issues with jellyfin since I knew he was a linux mint user. He said he also had similar issues with the program.\r\n\r\n- Would these problems persist with the docker version? Yes\r\n- Is the problem that I am using Fedora Server? Maybe\r\n- Is is the NVIDIA drivers? Maybe\r\n- Is it the crappy old hardware? Maybe\r\n- Was it the file permissions? No\r\n- Was it the configurations? No\r\n- Was it the TV? No\r\n\r\n## What to do\r\n\r\nHonestly my first instinct was to delve into the Jellyfin code and try to figure out what my issue was. Having already spent days sifting through reddit and github issues, I knew this would take longer than I wanted and would do nothing for my immediate problems. I wanted to add a feature to make Jellyfin go into a low hardware state and act as a file server if it can't transcode the files. Something like a safe-mode.  \r\nNot knowing if that was the actual issue and not having months to go over the code and do this, I decided to find a more simpe fix. \r\n\r\nTo use something else entirely after wasting days of my life troubleshooting. Sometimes I get tunnel-vision when troubleshooting and care more about the endorphine rush of solving the problem than finding the quickest or best solution. This didn't have to be a months long project to get everything perfect and I could still watch from my other computers using SMB. I just wanted to check off the rest of my boxes and get a media server running on old hardware.\r\n\r\nI remembered using PS3mediaServer as precursor to `Universal Media Server` back in the day.\r\nI figured it was time to revisit this avenue and see how UMS had progressed. \r\n\r\n## Enter Universal Media Server\r\n\r\n> Universal Media Server (UMS) is a DLNA compliant UPnP Media Server. Originally written to support the PlayStation 3, it has been expanded to support a range of other media renderers, including Xbox 360 and various televisions and media centers. Written in Java, it streams or transcodes many different media formats with minimum configuration from many platforms. It is supported by the MPlayer and FFmpeg packages.\r\n\r\n> It is powered by FFmpeg, MediaInfo, OpenSubtitles, Crowdin, MEncoder, tsMuxeR, AviSynth, VLC and more, which combine to offer support for a wide range of media formats.\r\n\r\nLet's see if it runs better now on Fedora Linux than it did on Windows 7 when I had last used it.\r\n\r\nI had a small issue with running on a server remotely vs running on a desktop OS, the lack of a GUI. Luckily there is kind of a headless mode for this software and a web interface. I mean it wouldn't really be a server software without headless mode, right?\r\n\r\nThe problem lies witht the headless mode not allowing me to access it from another computer. I needed to set the software up but had no DE (desktop environment) in order to pull it up in a browser on the same machine. This was a firewall issue as I state later on but it can happen to anyone. While I could SSH into the server, I couldn't pull up the web interface of UMS like I could pull up cockpit and some other dashboards. It's an easy fix that's near the end of the blog.\r\n\r\n### Installation on a server\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that you will have problems installing this software. In fact, it is pretty straight forward on most platforms, ie. Windows, Mac, most Linux dristros (assuming you know how to use AppImage or how to install from a tarball). There is even a Docker image for you to use regardless of OS. The only Installation documentation they give is for Docker as they seem to think that the other install methods are self explainatory.\r\n[Here](https://support.universalmediaserver.com/category/installation) is their installation documentation.\r\n\r\nHere is how I approached my install, completely via SSH.\r\n\r\nI SSH'd into the server, you could do the same if you are physically on the server. \r\n\r\nI started with downloading the tarball file from UMS with wget. \r\n`wget https://github.com/UniversalMediaServer/UniversalMediaServer/releases/download/14.9.0/UMS-Linux-14.9.0-x86_64.tgz` \r\n\r\nAfter the download I extracted and looked over the files. What's that tarball extraction command again? `tar -xvzf UMS-Linux-14.9.0-x86_64.tgz` works pretty well.\r\nWe get something like this:\r\n``` bash extraction\r\nuser@server:~$ tar -xvzf

you can see there are quite a few files here and there are a few config files. I then manually installed this program on the server by manually moving this directory into `/opt`. It is an optional program afterall. \r\nI suppose this could have been combined into the extraction step and I could have simply extracted into that folder. I could have also just gone with setting it up and running it from the download directory if I wanted to be a slob.\r\n\r\nI found a INSTALL.txt file that contained the following: \r\n``` INSTALL.txt\r\nInstallers for Windows and macOS and tarballs for Linux can be found at:\r\n\r\n    https://www.universalmediaserver.com\r\n\r\nTo install UMS from the tarball on Linux, open a terminal and enter the\r\nfollowing commands (set VERSION to the version you're installing):\r\nNote: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04, but something similar\r\nshould work on most Unix distributions)\r\n\r\n1. Install the dependencies (this only needs to be done once):\r\n    \r\n    All releases of UMS come with Java Runtime Environment bundled, except for\r\n    the ARM architecture releases. You will need to ensure you have JRE 17 installed.\r\n\r\n    Next, add some other pre-reqs:\r\n\r\n        sudo apt-get install mediainfo dcraw vlc-bin mplayer mencoder\r\n      \r\n  you can also optionally install dcraw: `sudo apt-get install dcraw`\r\n\r\n2. Download the tarball e.g.:\r\n\r\n    Get the direct link from https://www.universalmediaserver.com\r\n\r\n    Your operating system and architecture should be automatically detected so\r\n    that you get the correct download. If for some reason you get the wrong file,\r\n    you can manually select a file by clicking the big arrow to the right of the\r\n    download buttons.\r\n\r\n3. Extract the tarball into a ums-$VERSION directory:\r\n\r\n        tar xzvf ums-$VERSION.tgz\r\n\r\n4. Run (note: UMS should NOT be run as root):\r\n\r\n        cd ums-$VERSION\r\n        ./UMS.sh\r\n\r\nUMS accesses some files in the `ums-$VERSION/` directory (the working directory).\r\nOther files will be looked for in `~/.config/UMS`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key takeaway is that you need to install the dependencies `mediainfo dcraw vlc-bin mplayer mencoder`. Using dnf instead of apt-get or apt, obviously, I was able to find and install the dependencies.\r\nYou should also have the appropriate JRE, Java Runtime Environment not Joe Rogan Experience.\r\n\r\nLet's look into the config files.\r\n\r\nIn UMS.conf we can see a well written intro to the configuration files.\r\n\r\n``` bash UMS.conf\r\n# ============================================================================\r\n# Configuration file for Universal Media Server\r\n# ============================================================================\r\n# Introduction:\r\n#\r\n# This \"UMS.conf\" file holds the configuration settings for UMS. These\r\n# settings are usually set using a graphical user interface. If you are\r\n# running UMS on a headless system, you may may be able to access the web GUI\r\n# in a browser (see the web_gui_port setting), or you can edit this file.\r\n# A restart of UMS is required after editing this file.\r\n#\r\n# Commenting out an option or leaving it empty forces the UMS default\r\n# that is indicated.\r\n#\r\n# Key value pairs\r\n# ---------------\r\n# The configuration file contains key/value pairs separated by an equals (=)\r\n# sign; the key on the left and the value on the right. The value is edited in\r\n# this file or set using the UMS GUI and saved. The value can take a number of\r\n# different forms:\r\n#\r\n#  - toggle: a checkbox or boolean; either \"true\" or \"false\"\r\n#  - selector: a dropdown menu in the GUI, generating a string or numeric\r\n#              value. Available options will usually be stated below\r\n#  - string: a short text or a number\r\n#  - text: a longer text with embedded line breaks\r\n#  - list: a comma-separated list of strings or numbers\r\n#\r\n# In the file below the value type is shown after the Default label; strings\r\n# have quotation marks, toggles are true or false, the others are explained.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow this intro says we can use the GUI and the web GUI in order to set these configuration setting.\r\nI ignored this and went with the third option of editing the config file manually using nano over SSH, this is not recommended for beginners. \r\n\r\nYou not only don't have to do it this way but I would strongly advise against it unless you are a power user or are very familiar with the linux terminal.\r\nAs a matter of fact, I will be walking through how to get to the web interface as it is way more simple to setup.\r\n\r\nBasically we can go to <server_name>:webUI_port and see the gui of the server right?\r\nNot quite. \r\n\r\nFirst we have to run UMS.sh from the /opt/ums<ver> folder.\r\nWe might have to give it permissions to execute using sudo `sudo chmod +x`. Then we can run it in the background using the headless command. \r\n`./UMS.sh headless` or `sh UMS.sh headless`.\r\n\r\nWARNING: you may want to open the ports in the next step before running UMS as it might trigger the wizard to not run if you start it and then stop it.\r\n\r\nWhen we go to our server's IP and try to access the web ui on port 9001 we are blocked with the old `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error. This means we need to add a rule to the firewall to allow for the use of this port from other computers.\r\n\r\nHow do we do this? \r\nWe allow access through the firewall by adding the ports that UMS uses.\r\n\r\n- 5001 - For devices\r\n- 9001 - Admin Page -> this is the one we currently need for our setup\r\n- 9001 - Web Player\r\n\r\n`sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=5001/tcp --permanent`\r\n\r\n`sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=9001/tcp --permanent`\r\n\r\n`sudo firewall-cmd --zone=FedoraServer --add-port=9002/tcp --permanent`\r\n\r\nThis does depend on the zone name you have setup for your firewall but in my case it was FedoraServer. \r\n\r\nRestart UMS and try again.\r\n\r\nIf you are having issues with UMS not wanting to set up and just going to the login page eventhough you haven't created any users then you can turn on the setup wizard like so:\r\n``` bash UMS.conf\r\n# Run wizard on startup\r\n# ---------------------\r\n# When true, this offers to run a wizard with the most frequently-changed\r\n# settings to allow users to quickly customize UMS without digging through\r\n# all of our advanced settings\r\n# Default: true until it has run once\r\nrun_wizard = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have a desktop version of fedora or perhaps a server with a Desktop Environment installed, then you can do the configuration locally through the web ui or the actual GUI of the program. This will save some time.\r\n\r\nNow it is as simple as running the initial setup wizard and following the basic steps of creating a user, adding the media you want to be able to stream, and setting up your devices. The documentation actually gives a quick rundown of how to setup the [Security and Privacy](https://support.universalmediaserver.com/configuration/security-and-privacy), an [External API](https://support.universalmediaserver.com/configuration/external-api), and other [Guides](https://support.universalmediaserver.com/category/guides).\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI really like UMS and think it is one of the better media server solutions. It does a better job at recognizing media than Jellyfin, at least for me, and it allows for direct access to files and the ability to download them from your personal server. If you set this up on a server with a tailscale connection then you can access your media from anywhere. It is like having your own private Netflix or Hulu without the worry of your favorite movie getting removed without notice. You can have access you all of your old media that isn't streaming anywhere that you have physical copies of.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Docker user just want to stream stuff from your desktop then this is a great solution. \r\n\r\nAs long as we still have physical media, we will still have some form of ownership and domain over our viewing experience.","src/content/blog/lifestyle/media_server.md","4deb417ca6f783cc",{html:308,metadata:309},"<p>Warning — This is still a work in progress</p>\n<h2 id=\"intro\">Intro</h2>\n<p>With the rise and fall of streaming services and the withdrawel of several shows and movies that once justified their existence, it becomes increasingly hard to justify the cost. I found myself several times over watching something on a streaming service instead of just standing up and finding the DVD or BLURAY that I own. But when the benefits of convienience is taken away what are we left with? A costly bill of services unused, sometimes for months on end.</p>\n<p>I used to run XBMC and later KODI on my media PC and I even had it connected to my file server at one time. Over the years however, I have fellen prey to the smart-tv/streaming service trap. Netflix, Hulu, HBO max, Amazon, and Disney+ were all active on my TV. Having seen that I only watch a few services, and mostly for shows and movies I already own, I decided it was time to downsize. My roommate got the ad-tier of Netflix after I cancelled for their korean dramas and as it turned out we both had Hulu as they had a Disney+ subscription. I cancelled the HBO/Hulu subscription as I only really used it for The Last of Us and old movies. Also Hulu originals went down hill after they were acquired by the big D. Using my many shelves and boxes of Vinyls’s, CD’s, DVDs, Blu-rays, and even old VHSs it was time to use the backup’s I had once made and work on the new material I gained during the lazy times of the golden age of streaming. For legal reasons I won’t advocate for piracy eventhough many streamers, including LTT, may say they use it to aqcuire their “digital backups” of the media they own. I don’t want to debate that and will just say this is for your media files. I will also not go into detail on how to rip or backup media here as this is more about the streaming of personal files and not of their aqcuisition. I have spent many a black friday buying whole series of TV shows and collecting movies on sale.</p>\n<h2 id=\"file-server\">File server</h2>\n<p>Like many nerds, I have a file server for my backups and to store copies of my pictures, movies, and tv shows. I even keep copies of my ebooks and games so I hopefully don’t lose anything. Shoot, I even have copies of my old college work from my CS classes.</p>\n<p>The server is an old 8 core processor that can keep up with a few VMs and a server version of Fedora.\r\nThe GPU in the server is a 980ti Hybrid. A water cooled beast of a graphics card when it was new. Now unfortunately it’s 5 generations too old to be useful. It sucks at x265 and x264 transcoding, it doesn’t support AV1 or HEVC transcode, and it suffers from a bad case of NVIDIA drivers being garbage on linux. Thanks Jensen Huang. <br>\r\nEven the most basic of Intel CPUs can do these things nowadays but, who has money for upgrades in times like these?\r\nThe first upgrade I need is more large drives to fill out some zpools. A topic for another time…</p>\n<p>I can easily install a media server in either docker or directly on the system since I am t he only one using it.\r\nThe question is which one?</p>\n<p>I know I want the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UPnP support - so my smart TV picks it up with no fuss</li>\n<li>A web interface - so I can watch from other computers</li>\n<li>Basic transcoding abilities - not all formats play on all devices</li>\n<li>For it to recognize basic metadata - even if I have to add it in a separate file</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the rise of people complaining about plex and the point being to freely watch my own content, I also what it to be free and open source if possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jellyfin\">Jellyfin?</h2>\n<p>Having seen the power of jellyfin a few years back I decided to run it on my fileserver. It worked pretty well when I tried it on windows and it did a fair job of figuring out what my media was. The problem? My file server runs linux and, while I have heard of people having good luck running Jellyfin on linux, I have not. I only have bout 7 TB in my desktop and, while that sounds like a enough to serve some media, most of my space is taken up by steam games and projects.\r\nThis is why it is crucial to run it on my server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jellyfin-is-great-until-it-isnt\">Jellyfin is great, until it isn’t</h2>\n<p>Anyways, long story long, I have problems running Jellyfin on my file server. Jellyfin recognizes the folder and will show the files when I’m in the folder mode, but it refuses to find metadata and recognize the media enough to sort it into the appropriate library. I ruled out permissions issues and configuration issues through days of troubleshooting. I even went as far as to use TinyMediaManager to rename and manually find metadata for serveral of the files. You would think with the shows and movies being recognized my TinyMediaManager, the files/folders being renamed, and the metadata being saved, that Jellyfin would quickly recognize the media right?</p>\n<p>Apparantly not.</p>\n<p>It will sometimes recognize the media as it will show episodes of TV shows in the “suggested” or “newly added” sections but it doesn’t show in the actual “shows” section. Sometimes I can get Jellyfin to find and recognize shows just to not play anything claiming there was no playable media found. Thinking this could be transcode issues I made sure the files would play fine through a vlc stream.</p>\n<p>That being, said I also know my TV can directly play some of these files from flash drives.\r\nWhy can’t Jellyfin just serve up these files directly without transcode issues or recognition issues?</p>\n<p>After days of changing permissions, renaming files, making nfo files for the metadata using tinyMediaManager, and even completely removing the program and reinstalling I still had the same issues. The documentation always shows how to do things on debian. Is the problem that I am using Fedora?</p>\n<p>I asked my brother if he had issues with jellyfin since I knew he was a linux mint user. He said he also had similar issues with the program.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Would these problems persist with the docker version? Yes</li>\n<li>Is the problem that I am using Fedora Server? Maybe</li>\n<li>Is is the NVIDIA drivers? Maybe</li>\n<li>Is it the crappy old hardware? Maybe</li>\n<li>Was it the file permissions? No</li>\n<li>Was it the configurations? No</li>\n<li>Was it the TV? No</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-do\">What to do</h2>\n<p>Honestly my first instinct was to delve into the Jellyfin code and try to figure out what my issue was. Having already spent days sifting through reddit and github issues, I knew this would take longer than I wanted and would do nothing for my immediate problems. I wanted to add a feature to make Jellyfin go into a low hardware state and act as a file server if it can’t transcode the files. Something like a safe-mode.<br>\nNot knowing if that was the actual issue and not having months to go over the code and do this, I decided to find a more simpe fix.</p>\n<p>To use something else entirely after wasting days of my life troubleshooting. Sometimes I get tunnel-vision when troubleshooting and care more about the endorphine rush of solving the problem than finding the quickest or best solution. This didn’t have to be a months long project to get everything perfect and I could still watch from my other computers using SMB. I just wanted to check off the rest of my boxes and get a media server running on old hardware.</p>\n<p>I remembered using PS3mediaServer as precursor to <code>Universal Media Server</code> back in the day.\r\nI figured it was time to revisit this avenue and see how UMS had progressed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enter-universal-media-server\">Enter Universal Media Server</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Universal Media Server (UMS) is a DLNA compliant UPnP Media Server. Originally written to support the PlayStation 3, it has been expanded to support a range of other media renderers, including Xbox 360 and various televisions and media centers. Written in Java, it streams or transcodes many different media formats with minimum configuration from many platforms. It is supported by the MPlayer and FFmpeg packages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is powered by FFmpeg, MediaInfo, OpenSubtitles, Crowdin, MEncoder, tsMuxeR, AviSynth, VLC and more, which combine to offer support for a wide range of media formats.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let’s see if it runs better now on Fedora Linux than it did on Windows 7 when I had last used it.</p>\n<p>I had a small issue with running on a server remotely vs running on a desktop OS, the lack of a GUI. Luckily there is kind of a headless mode for this software and a web interface. I mean it wouldn’t really be a server software without headless mode, right?</p>\n<p>The problem lies witht the headless mode not allowing me to access it from another computer. I needed to set the software up but had no DE (desktop environment) in order to pull it up in a browser on the same machine. This was a firewall issue as I state later on but it can happen to anyone. While I could SSH into the server, I couldn’t pull up the web interface of UMS like I could pull up cockpit and some other dashboards. It’s an easy fix that’s near the end of the blog.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installation-on-a-server\">Installation on a server</h3>\n<p>I’m not saying that you will have problems installing this software. In fact, it is pretty straight forward on most platforms, ie. Windows, Mac, most Linux dristros (assuming you know how to use AppImage or how to install from a tarball). There is even a Docker image for you to use regardless of OS. The only Installation documentation they give is for Docker as they seem to think that the other install methods are self explainatory.\r\n<a href=\"https://support.universalmediaserver.com/category/installation\">Here</a> is their installation documentation.</p>\n<p>Here is how I approached my install, completely via SSH.</p>\n<p>I SSH’d into the server, you could do the same if you are physically on the server.</p>\n<p>I started with downloading the tarball file from UMS with wget.\r\n<code>wget https://github.com/UniversalMediaServer/UniversalMediaServer/releases/download/14.9.0/UMS-Linux-14.9.0-x86_64.tgz</code></p>\n<p>After the download I extracted and looked over the files. What’s that tarball extraction command again? <code>tar -xvzf UMS-Linux-14.9.0-x86_64.tgz</code> works pretty well.\r\nWe get something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\"

I then manually installed this program on the server by manually moving this directory into <code>/opt</code>. It is an optional program afterall.\r\nI suppose this could have been combined into the extraction step and I could have simply extracted into that folder. I could have also just gone with setting it up and running it from the download directory if I wanted to be a slob.</p>\n<p>I found a INSTALL.txt file that contained the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>Installers for Windows and macOS and tarballs for Linux can be found at:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    https://www.universalmediaserver.com</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>To install UMS from the tarball on Linux, open a terminal and enter the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>following commands (set VERSION to the version you're installing):</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Note: These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04, but something similar</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>should work on most Unix distributions)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>1.

The documentation actually gives a quick rundown of how to setup the <a href=\"https://support.universalmediaserver.com/configuration/security-and-privacy\">Security and Privacy</a>, an <a href=\"https://support.universalmediaserver.com/configuration/external-api\">External API</a>, and other <a href=\"https://support.universalmediaserver.com/category/guides\">Guides</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I really like UMS and think it is one of the better media server solutions. It does a better job at recognizing media than Jellyfin, at least for me, and it allows for direct access to files and the ability to download them from your personal server. If you set this up on a server with a tailscale connection then you can access your media from anywhere. It is like having your own private Netflix or Hulu without the worry of your favorite movie getting removed without notice. You can have access you all of your old media that isn’t streaming anywhere that you have physical copies of.</p>\n<p>If you are a Docker user just want to stream stuff from your desktop then this is a great solution.</p>\n<p>As long as we still have physical media, we will still have some form of ownership and domain over our viewing experience.</p>",{headings:310,localImagePaths:331,remoteImagePaths:332,frontmatter:333,imagePaths:335},[311,312,315,318,321,324,327,330],{depth:40,slug:73,text:74},{depth:40,slug:313,text:314},"file-server","File server",{depth:40,slug:316,text:317},"jellyfin","Jellyfin?",{depth:40,slug:319,text:320},"jellyfin-is-great-until-it-isnt","Jellyfin is great, until it isn’t",{depth:40,slug:322,text:323},"what-to-do","What to do",{depth:40,slug:325,text:326},"enter-universal-media-server","Enter Universal Media Server",{depth:50,slug:328,text:329},"installation-on-a-server","Installation on a server",{depth:40,slug:148,text:149},[],[],{title:301,description:302,author:294,pubDate:334,draft:30},"02/14/2025",[],"lifestyle/media_server.md","linux_commands/grep",{id:337,data:339,body:345,filePath:346,digest:347,rendered:348,legacyId:367},{title:340,description:341,pubDate:342,updatedDate:343,draft:30,category:344},"Grep","Grep reference",["Date","2023-01-07T05:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2023-03-02T05:00:00.000Z"],"Linux Commands","<!-- # GREP -->\r\n\r\n## What is GREP\r\n\r\n**GREP** stands for **G**lobal **R**egular **E**xpresion **P**rint.

PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by newline characters,\r\n        and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when grep is used in  a\r\n        shell command.\r\n\r\n        A  FILE  of  “-”  stands  for  standard  input.   If  no FILE is given, recursive searches examine the working\r\n        directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.\r\n\r\n        In addition, the variant programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are  the  same  as  grep -E,  grep -F,  and  grep -r,\r\n        respectively.  These variants are deprecated, but are provided for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n    OPTIONS\r\n    Generic Program Information\r\n        --help Output a usage message and exit.\r\n\r\n        -V, --version\r\n                Output the version number of grep and exit.\r\n\r\n    Pattern Syntax\r\n        -E, --extended-regexp\r\n                Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions (EREs, see below).\r\n\r\n        -F, --fixed-strings\r\n                Interpret PATTERNS as fixed strings, not regular expressions.\r\n\r\n        -G, --basic-regexp\r\n                Interpret PATTERNS as basic regular expressions (BREs, see below).  This is the default.\r\n\r\n        -P, --perl-regexp\r\n                Interpret  PATTERNS  as  Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCREs).  This option is experimental when\r\n                combined with the -z (--null-data) option, and grep -P may warn of unimplemented features.\r\n\r\n    Matching Control\r\n        -e PATTERNS, --regexp=PATTERNS\r\n                Use PATTERNS as the patterns.  If this option is used  multiple  times  or  is  combined  with  the  -f\r\n                (--file) option, search for all patterns given.  This option can be used to protect a pattern beginning\r\n                with “-”.\r\n\r\n        -f FILE, --file=FILE\r\n                Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the\r\n                -e  (--regexp)  option,  search  for  all  patterns  given.  The empty file contains zero patterns, and\r\n                therefore matches nothing.\r\n\r\n        -i, --ignore-case\r\n                Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so that characters that differ only in case  match\r\n                each other.\r\n\r\n        --no-ignore-case\r\n                Do  not  ignore  case  distinctions  in  patterns and input data.  This is the default.  This option is\r\n                useful for passing to shell scripts that already use -i, to cancel its effects because the two  options\r\n                override each other.\r\n\r\n        -v, --invert-match\r\n                Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.\r\n\r\n        -w, --word-regexp\r\n                Select  only  those  lines  containing  matches  that  form whole words.  The test is that the matching\r\n                substring must either be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent character.\r\n                Similarly,  it  must  be either at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent character.\r\n                Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.  This option has no effect  if  -x\r\n                is also specified.\r\n\r\n        -x, --line-regexp\r\n                Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.  For a regular expression pattern, this is\r\n                like parenthesizing the pattern and then surrounding it with ^ and $.\r\n\r\n        -y     Obsolete synonym for -i.\r\n\r\n    General Output Control\r\n        -c, --count\r\n                Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each  input  file.   With  the  -v,\r\n                --invert-match option (see below), count non-matching lines.\r\n\r\n        --color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]\r\n                Surround the matched (non-empty) strings, matching lines, context lines, file names, line numbers, byte\r\n                offsets, and separators (for fields and groups of context lines) with escape sequences to display  them\r\n                in  color  on  the  terminal.   The  colors  are  defined by the environment variable GREP_COLORS.  The\r\n                deprecated environment variable GREP_COLOR is still supported, but its setting does not have  priority.\r\n                WHEN is never, always, or auto.\r\n\r\n        -L, --files-without-match\r\n                Suppress  normal  output; instead print the name of each input file from which no output would normally\r\n                have been printed.  The scanning will stop on the first match.\r\n\r\n        -l, --files-with-matches\r\n                Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally have\r\n                been printed.  The scanning will stop on the first match.\r\n\r\n        -m NUM, --max-count=NUM\r\n                Stop  reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If the input is standard input from a regular file, and\r\n                NUM matching lines are output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned  to  just  after  the\r\n                last  matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing context lines.  This enables\r\n                a calling process to resume a search.  When grep  stops  after  NUM  matching  lines,  it  outputs  any\r\n                trailing  context  lines.   When  the  -c  or --count option is also used, grep does not output a count\r\n                greater than NUM.  When the -v or --invert-match option is also used, grep stops after  outputting  NUM\r\n                non-matching lines.\r\n\r\n        -o, --only-matching\r\n                Print  only  the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output\r\n                line.\r\n\r\n        -q, --quiet, --silent\r\n                Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.  Exit immediately with zero status  if  any  match  is\r\n                found, even if an error was detected.  Also see the -s or --no-messages option.\r\n\r\n        -s, --no-messages\r\n                Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.\r\n\r\n    Output Line Prefix Control\r\n        -b, --byte-offset\r\n                Print   the   0-based  byte  offset  within  the  input  file  before  each  line  of  output.   If  -o\r\n                (--only-matching) is specified, print the offset of the matching part itself.\r\n\r\n        -H, --with-filename\r\n                Print the file name for each match.  This is the default when there is more than one file to search.\r\n\r\n        -h, --no-filename\r\n                Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is the default when there is only  one  file  (or\r\n                only standard input) to search.\r\n\r\n        --label=LABEL\r\n                Display  input actually coming from standard input as input coming from file LABEL.  This can be useful\r\n                for commands that transform  a  file's  contents  before  searching,  e.g.,  gzip  -cd  foo.gz  |  grep\r\n                --label=foo -H 'some pattern'.  See also the -H option.\r\n\r\n        -n, --line-number\r\n                Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.\r\n\r\n        -T, --initial-tab\r\n                Make  sure that the first character of actual line content lies on a tab stop, so that the alignment of\r\n                tabs looks normal.  This is useful with options that prefix their output to the actual content:  -H,-n,\r\n                and  -b.   In order to improve the probability that lines from a single file will all start at the same\r\n                column, this also causes the line number and byte offset (if present) to be printed in a  minimum  size\r\n                field width.\r\n\r\n        -u, --unix-byte-offsets\r\n                Report  Unix-style  byte offsets.  This switch causes grep to report byte offsets as if the file were a\r\n                Unix-style text file, i.e., with CR characters stripped off.  This will produce  results  identical  to\r\n                running  grep  on  a  Unix machine.  This option has no effect unless -b option is also used; it has no\r\n                effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.\r\n\r\n        -Z, --null\r\n                Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the character  that  normally  follows  a  file\r\n                name.   For  example,  grep  -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file name instead of the usual newline.\r\n                This option makes the output unambiguous, even  in  the  presence  of  file  names  containing  unusual\r\n                characters  like  newlines.  This option can be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z,\r\n                and xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.\r\n\r\n    Context Line Control\r\n        -A NUM, --after-context=NUM\r\n                Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.  Places a line containing a  group  separator\r\n                (--)  between  contiguous groups of matches.  With the -o or --only-matching option, this has no effect\r\n                and a warning is given.\r\n\r\n        -B NUM, --before-context=NUM\r\n                Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.  Places a line containing a  group  separator\r\n                (--)  between  contiguous groups of matches.  With the -o or --only-matching option, this has no effect\r\n                and a warning is given.\r\n\r\n        -C NUM, -NUM, --context=NUM\r\n                Print NUM lines of output context.  Places a line containing a group separator (--) between  contiguous\r\n                groups of matches.  With the -o or --only-matching option, this has no effect and a warning is given.\r\n\r\n    File and Directory Selection\r\n        -a, --text\r\n                Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the --binary-files=text option.\r\n\r\n        --binary-files=TYPE\r\n                If  a  file's  data or metadata indicate that the file contains binary data, assume that the file is of\r\n                type TYPE.  Non-text bytes indicate binary data; these are either  output  bytes  that  are  improperly\r\n                encoded for the current locale, or null input bytes when the -z option is not given.\r\n\r\n                By  default, TYPE is binary, and grep suppresses output after null input binary data is discovered, and\r\n                suppresses output lines that contain improperly encoded data.  When some  output  is  suppressed,  grep\r\n                follows any output with a one-line message saying that a binary file matches.\r\n\r\n                If  TYPE  is  without-match, when grep discovers null input binary data it assumes that the rest of the\r\n                file does not match; this is equivalent to the -I option.\r\n\r\n                If TYPE is text, grep processes a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the -a option.\r\n\r\n                When type is binary, grep may treat non-text bytes as line terminators  even  without  the  -z  option.\r\n                This  means choosing binary versus text can affect whether a pattern matches a file.  For example, when\r\n                type is binary the pattern q$ might match q immediately followed by a null byte, even  though  this  is\r\n                not  matched when type is text.  Conversely, when type is binary the pattern . (period) might not match\r\n                a null byte.\r\n\r\n                Warning: The -a option might output binary garbage, which can have nasty side effects if the output  is\r\n                a  terminal  and  if  the  terminal  driver interprets some of it as commands.  On the other hand, when\r\n                reading files whose text encodings are unknown, it can be helpful to use -a or to set LC_ALL='C' in the\r\n                environment, in order to find more matches even if the matches are unsafe for direct display.\r\n\r\n        -D ACTION, --devices=ACTION\r\n                If  an  input  file is a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to process it.  By default, ACTION is read,\r\n                which means that devices are read just as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip, devices  are\r\n                silently skipped.\r\n\r\n        -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION\r\n                If  an  input  file  is  a directory, use ACTION to process it.  By default, ACTION is read, i.e., read\r\n                directories just as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip,  silently  skip  directories.   If\r\n                ACTION  is  recurse, read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if\r\n                they are on the command line.  This is equivalent to the -r option.\r\n\r\n        --exclude=GLOB\r\n                Skip any command-line file with a name suffix that matches the pattern GLOB, using wildcard matching; a\r\n                name  suffix  is  either  the  whole  name,  or  a trailing part that starts with a non-slash character\r\n                immediately after a slash (/) in the name.  When searching recursively, skip  any  subfile  whose  base\r\n                name  matches  GLOB; the base name is the part after the last slash.  A pattern can use *, ?, and [...]\r\n                as wildcards, and \\ to quote a wildcard or backslash character literally.\r\n\r\n        --exclude-from=FILE\r\n                Skip files whose base name matches any of the file-name globs read from FILE (using  wildcard  matching\r\n                as described under --exclude).\r\n\r\n        --exclude-dir=GLOB\r\n                Skip  any  command-line  directory  with  a  name suffix that matches the pattern GLOB.  When searching\r\n                recursively, skip any subdirectory whose base name matches GLOB.  Ignore any redundant trailing slashes\r\n                in GLOB.\r\n\r\n        -I     Process  a  binary  file  as  if  it  did  not  contain  matching  data;  this  is  equivalent  to  the\r\n                --binary-files=without-match option.\r\n\r\n        --include=GLOB\r\n                Search only files whose base name matches GLOB (using wildcard matching as described under  --exclude).\r\n                If  contradictory  --include  and  --exclude  options  are  given,  the  last matching one wins.  If no\r\n                --include or --exclude options match, a file is included unless the first such option is --include.\r\n\r\n        -r, --recursive\r\n                Read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only  if  they  are  on  the\r\n                command  line.   Note  that  if no file operand is given, grep searches the working directory.  This is\r\n                equivalent to the -d recurse option.\r\n\r\n        -R, --dereference-recursive\r\n                Read all files under each directory, recursively.  Follow all symbolic links, unlike -r.\r\n\r\n    Other Options\r\n        --line-buffered\r\n                Use line buffering on output.  This can cause a performance penalty.\r\n\r\n        -U, --binary\r\n                Treat the file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows, grep guesses whether a  file  is\r\n                text or binary as described for the --binary-files option.  If grep decides the file is a text file, it\r\n                strips the CR characters from the original file contents (to make regular expressions with ^ and $ work\r\n                correctly).   Specifying  -U  overrules  this guesswork, causing all files to be read and passed to the\r\n                matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line,  this\r\n                will  cause some regular expressions to fail.  This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS\r\n                and MS-Windows.\r\n\r\n        -z, --null-data\r\n                Treat input and output data as sequences of lines, each terminated  by  a  zero  byte  (the  ASCII  NUL\r\n                character)  instead  of a newline.  Like the -Z or --null option, this option can be used with commands\r\n                like sort -z to process arbitrary file names.\r\n\r\n    REGULAR EXPRESSIONS\r\n        A regular expression is a pattern that describes a  set  of  strings.   Regular  expressions  are  constructed\r\n        analogously to arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.\r\n\r\n        grep  understands  three  different versions of regular expression syntax: “basic” (BRE), “extended” (ERE) and\r\n        “perl” (PCRE).  In GNU grep there is no difference in  available  functionality  between  basic  and  extended\r\n        syntaxes.   In  other implementations, basic regular expressions are less powerful.  The following description\r\n        applies to extended regular expressions; differences for basic regular expressions are summarized  afterwards.\r\n        Perl-compatible  regular  expressions  give  additional functionality, and are documented in pcresyntax(3) and\r\n        pcrepattern(3), but work only if PCRE is available in the system.\r\n\r\n        The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character.   Most  characters,\r\n        including  all  letters  and  digits,  are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any meta-character with\r\n        special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.\r\n\r\n        The period . matches any single character.  It is unspecified whether it matches an encoding error.\r\n\r\n    Character Classes and Bracket Expressions\r\n        A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by [ and ].  It matches any  single  character  in  that\r\n        list.   If the first character of the list is the caret ^ then it matches any character not in the list; it is\r\n        unspecified whether it matches an encoding error.  For example, the regular  expression  [0123456789]  matches\r\n        any single digit.\r\n\r\n        Within  a bracket expression, a range expression consists of two characters separated by a hyphen.  It matches\r\n        any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's  collating  sequence\r\n        and  character  set.   For example, in the default C locale, [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd].  Many locales sort\r\n        characters in dictionary order, and in these locales [a-d] is typically not equivalent to [abcd]; it might  be\r\n        equivalent  to  [aBbCcDd],  for example.  To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you\r\n        can use the C locale by setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the value C.\r\n\r\n        Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within bracket  expressions,  as  follows.   Their\r\n        names  are  self  explanatory,  and they are [:alnum:], [:alpha:], [:blank:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:],\r\n        [:lower:], [:print:], [:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], and [:xdigit:].  For  example,  [[:alnum:]]  means  the\r\n        character  class  of  numbers  and  letters  in  the  current locale.  In the C locale and ASCII character set\r\n        encoding, this is the same as [0-9A-Za-z].  (Note that the brackets in these  class  names  are  part  of  the\r\n        symbolic  names,  and  must  be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket expression.)  Most\r\n        meta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions.  To include a literal ] place it  first\r\n        in  the list.  Similarly, to include a literal ^ place it anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a literal -\r\n        place it last.\r\n\r\n    Anchoring\r\n        The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are  meta-characters  that  respectively  match  the  empty  string  at  the\r\n        beginning and end of a line.\r\n\r\n    The Backslash Character and Special Expressions\r\n        The  symbols  \\< and \\> respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word.  The symbol \\b\r\n        matches the empty string at the edge of a word, and \\B matches the empty string provided it's not at the  edge\r\n        of a word.  The symbol \\w is a synonym for [_[:alnum:]] and \\W is a synonym for [^_[:alnum:]].\r\n\r\n    Repetition\r\n        A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:\r\n        ?      The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.\r\n        *      The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.\r\n        +      The preceding item will be matched one or more times.\r\n        {n}    The preceding item is matched exactly n times.\r\n        {n,}   The preceding item is matched n or more times.\r\n        {,m}   The preceding item is matched at most m times.  This is a GNU extension.\r\n        {n,m}  The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times.\r\n\r\n    Concatenation\r\n        Two  regular  expressions  may  be concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any string formed by\r\n        concatenating two substrings that respectively match the concatenated expressions.\r\n\r\n    Alternation\r\n        Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator |; the resulting regular  expression  matches  any\r\n        string matching either alternate expression.\r\n\r\n    Precedence\r\n        Repetition  takes  precedence  over  concatenation,  which in turn takes precedence over alternation.  A whole\r\n        expression may be enclosed in parentheses to override these precedence rules and form a subexpression.\r\n\r\n    Back-references and Subexpressions\r\n        The back-reference \\n, where n is a single  digit,  matches  the  substring  previously  matched  by  the  nth\r\n        parenthesized subexpression of the regular expression.\r\n\r\n    Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions\r\n        In  basic regular expressions the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (, and ) lose their special meaning; instead use\r\n        the backslashed versions \\?, \\+, \\{, \\|, \\(, and \\).\r\n\r\n    EXIT STATUS\r\n        Normally the exit status is 0 if a line is selected, 1 if no lines were selected, and 2 if an error  occurred.\r\n        However,  if  the  -q  or  --quiet or --silent is used and a line is selected, the exit status is 0 even if an\r\n        error occurred.\r\n\r\n    ENVIRONMENT\r\n        The behavior of grep is affected by the following environment variables.\r\n\r\n        The locale for category LC_foo is specified by examining the three environment variables LC_ALL, LC_foo, LANG,\r\n        in  that order.  The first of these variables that is set specifies the locale.  For example, if LC_ALL is not\r\n        set, but LC_MESSAGES is set to pt_BR, then the  Brazilian  Portuguese  locale  is  used  for  the  LC_MESSAGES\r\n        category.   The  C locale is used if none of these environment variables are set, if the locale catalog is not\r\n        installed, or if grep was not compiled with national language support (NLS).   The  shell  command  locale  -a\r\n        lists locales that are currently available.\r\n\r\n        GREP_COLOR\r\n                This  variable  specifies  the  color  used to highlight matched (non-empty) text.  It is deprecated in\r\n                favor of GREP_COLORS, but still supported.  The  mt,  ms,  and  mc  capabilities  of  GREP_COLORS  have\r\n                priority  over  it.  It can only specify the color used to highlight the matching non-empty text in any\r\n                matching line (a selected line when the -v command-line option is omitted, or a context line when -v is\r\n                specified).   The  default  is  01;31, which means a bold red foreground text on the terminal's default\r\n                background.\r\n\r\n        GREP_COLORS\r\n                Specifies the colors and other attributes used to highlight various parts of the output.  Its value  is\r\n                a        colon-separated        list        of        capabilities        that        defaults       to\r\n                ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36 with the  rv  and  ne  boolean  capabilities  omitted\r\n                (i.e., false).  Supported capabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\n                sl=    SGR  substring for whole selected lines (i.e., matching lines when the -v command-line option is\r\n                        omitted, or non-matching lines when -v is specified).  If however the boolean rv capability  and\r\n                        the  -v  command-line  option  are both specified, it applies to context matching lines instead.\r\n                        The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).\r\n\r\n                cx=    SGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-matching lines when the -v command-line  option\r\n                        is  omitted,  or matching lines when -v is specified).  If however the boolean rv capability and\r\n                        the -v command-line option are  both  specified,  it  applies  to  selected  non-matching  lines\r\n                        instead.  The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).\r\n\r\n                rv     Boolean  value  that  reverses  (swaps) the meanings of the sl= and cx= capabilities when the -v\r\n                        command-line option is specified.  The default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).\r\n\r\n                mt=01;31\r\n                        SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any matching line (i.e., a selected line  when  the\r\n                        -v  command-line  option  is  omitted, or a context line when -v is specified).  Setting this is\r\n                        equivalent to setting both ms= and mc= at once to the same value.  The default  is  a  bold  red\r\n                        text foreground over the current line background.\r\n\r\n                ms=01;31\r\n                        SGR  substring  for  matching non-empty text in a selected line.  (This is only used when the -v\r\n                        command-line option is omitted.)  The effect of the sl= (or cx= if rv) capability remains active\r\n                        when this kicks in.  The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.\r\n\r\n                mc=01;31\r\n                        SGR  substring  for  matching  non-empty text in a context line.  (This is only used when the -v\r\n                        command-line option is specified.)  The effect of the cx= (or  sl=  if  rv)  capability  remains\r\n                        active  when  this  kicks  in.   The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line\r\n                        background.\r\n\r\n                fn=35  SGR substring for file names prefixing  any  content  line.   The  default  is  a  magenta  text\r\n                        foreground over the terminal's default background.\r\n\r\n                ln=32  SGR  substring  for  line  numbers  prefixing  any  content  line.   The default is a green text\r\n                        foreground over the terminal's default background.\r\n\r\n                bn=32  SGR substring for byte offsets prefixing  any  content  line.   The  default  is  a  green  text\r\n                        foreground over the terminal's default background.\r\n\r\n                se=36  SGR substring for separators that are inserted between selected line fields (:), between context\r\n                        line fields, (-), and between groups of adjacent lines when nonzero context is  specified  (--).\r\n                        The default is a cyan text foreground over the terminal's default background.\r\n\r\n                ne     Boolean  value  that  prevents  clearing  to  the  end of line using Erase in Line (EL) to Right\r\n                        (\\33[K) each time a colorized item ends.  This is  needed  on  terminals  on  which  EL  is  not\r\n                        supported.   It  is  otherwise  useful on terminals for which the back_color_erase (bce) boolean\r\n                        terminfo capability does not  apply,  when  the  chosen  highlight  colors  do  not  affect  the\r\n                        background,  or when EL is too slow or causes too much flicker.  The default is false (i.e., the\r\n                        capability is omitted).\r\n\r\n                Note that boolean capabilities have no =... part.  They are omitted (i.e., false) by default and become\r\n                true when specified.\r\n\r\n                See  the  Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the documentation of the text terminal that is used\r\n                for permitted values and their meaning as character attributes.  These substring values are integers in\r\n                decimal  representation  and  can  be  concatenated with semicolons.  grep takes care of assembling the\r\n                result into a complete SGR sequence (\\33[...m).  Common values to concatenate include 1 for bold, 4 for\r\n                underline, 5 for blink, 7 for inverse, 39 for default foreground color, 30 to 37 for foreground colors,\r\n                90 to 97 for 16-color mode foreground colors, 38;5;0 to  38;5;255  for  88-color  and  256-color  modes\r\n                foreground  colors,  49  for  default  background color, 40 to 47 for background colors, 100 to 107 for\r\n                16-color mode background colors, and 48;5;0 to 48;5;255 for 88-color  and  256-color  modes  background\r\n                colors.\r\n\r\n        LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LANG\r\n                These variables specify the locale for the LC_COLLATE category, which determines the collating sequence\r\n                used to interpret range expressions like [a-z].\r\n\r\n        LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG\r\n                These variables specify the locale for the LC_CTYPE category, which determines the type of  characters,\r\n                e.g.,  which characters are whitespace.  This category also determines the character encoding, that is,\r\n                whether text is encoded in UTF-8, ASCII, or some other  encoding.   In  the  C  or  POSIX  locale,  all\r\n                characters are encoded as a single byte and every byte is a valid character.\r\n\r\n        LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG\r\n                These  variables  specify  the  locale for the LC_MESSAGES category, which determines the language that\r\n                grep uses for messages.  The default C locale uses American English messages.\r\n\r\n        POSIXLY_CORRECT\r\n                If set, grep behaves as POSIX requires; otherwise, grep behaves more like other  GNU  programs.   POSIX\r\n                requires  that  options  that follow file names must be treated as file names; by default, such options\r\n                are permuted to the front of the operand list and are treated as options.  Also,  POSIX  requires  that\r\n                unrecognized  options  be  diagnosed  as  “illegal”,  but since they are not really against the law the\r\n                default is to diagnose them as “invalid”.  POSIXLY_CORRECT also disables  _N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_,\r\n                described below.\r\n\r\n        _N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_\r\n                (Here N is grep's numeric process ID.)  If the ith character of this environment variable's value is 1,\r\n                do not consider the ith operand of grep to be an option, even if it appears to be one.  A shell can put\r\n                this variable in the environment for each command it runs, specifying which operands are the results of\r\n                file name wildcard expansion and therefore  should  not  be  treated  as  options.   This  behavior  is\r\n                available only with the GNU C library, and only when POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set.\r\n\r\n    NOTES\r\n        This man page is maintained only fitfully; the full documentation is often more up-to-date.\r\n\r\n    COPYRIGHT\r\n        Copyright 1998-2000, 2002, 2005-2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n\r\n        This  is  free  software;  see  the  source  for  copying  conditions.

A regex expression is a form of pattern matching. For the purpose of this article we will skip the regex tutorial. \r\n\r\nHere are some basics for a recap.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anchors\r\nThese are expressions that signify a position as a condition. Using one of these means that for there to be a match then you must find the particular phrase in the required position. For example, when we use `^` we are signifying that the phrase after it must be at the beginning of any match. Say `^c` would be true for `chris` but would be false for `back`. In the first case we have the word `chris` which begins with a c. This provides a match and thus is true for the regex of `^c`. Since `back` only contains a c at the end it does not satisfy the case of `^c`. \r\n\r\n| Expression    | Description      | Example                                      |\r\n| ---           | ---              | ---                                          |\r\n| ^[exp]        | Start            | ^a  - \"Hola <u>**a**</u>migo\"                |\r\n| \\A[exp]       | Start            | \\Aa - \"Hola <u>**a**</u>migo\"                |\r\n| [exp]$        | End              | d$  - \"Hello Worl<u>**d**</u>\"               |\r\n| [exp]\\Z       | End              | d\\Z - \"Hello Worl<u>**d**</u>\"               |\r\n| \\b[exp]\\b     | Word Boundary    | \\bme\\b - \"<u>**me**</u> not some\"          |\r\n| \\B[exp]\\B     | Not Word Boundary| \\Bme\\B - \"Ho<u>**me**</u>r not me or some\" |\r\n\r\n*Note: The use of [exp] is designed to represent a standalone expression. This should not be confused wtih the actual brackets notation.*\r\n\r\nLet's look at those work boudaries. They are a bit strange but useful. If a word is a group of letters then a word boundary is the edge of that word. In other words, a letter next to a space would be a word boundary. `/b` is a word boundary. The side of the expression you apply /b to is the side of the expression that you want a boundary on. If both side have a boundary then you can safely say you are looking for an exact word match. This looks like `/bword\\b`. If we want a phrase that ends with an expression then we can use `[exp]\\b`.\r\n\r\nTODO: add some examples of these being demonstrated in the console.

[FILE...]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>DESCRIPTION</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    grep  searches  for  PATTERNS in each FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by newline characters,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when grep is used in  a</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    shell command.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    A  FILE  of  “-”  stands  for  standard  input.   If  no FILE is given, recursive searches examine the working</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    In addition, the variant programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are  the  same  as  grep -E,  grep -F,  and  grep -r,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    respectively.  These variants are deprecated, but are provided for backward compatibility.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>OPTIONS</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Generic Program Information</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --help Output a usage message and exit.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -V, --version</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Output the version number of grep and exit.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Pattern Syntax</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -E, --extended-regexp</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions (EREs, see below).</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -F, --fixed-strings</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Interpret PATTERNS as fixed strings, not regular expressions.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -G, --basic-regexp</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Interpret PATTERNS as basic regular expressions (BREs, see below).  This is the default.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -P, --perl-regexp</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Interpret  PATTERNS  as  Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCREs).  This option is experimental when</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            combined with the -z (--null-data) option, and grep -P may warn of unimplemented features.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Matching Control</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -e PATTERNS, --regexp=PATTERNS</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Use PATTERNS as the patterns.  If this option is used  multiple  times  or  is  combined  with  the  -f</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            (--file) option, search for all patterns given.  This option can be used to protect a pattern beginning</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            with “-”.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -f FILE, --file=FILE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            -e  (--regexp)  option,  search  for  all  patterns  given.  The empty file contains zero patterns, and</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            therefore matches nothing.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -i, --ignore-case</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so that characters that differ only in case  match</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            each other.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --no-ignore-case</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Do  not  ignore  case  distinctions  in  patterns and input data.  This is the default.  This option is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            useful for passing to shell scripts that already use -i, to cancel its effects because the two  options</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            override each other.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -v, --invert-match</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -w, --word-regexp</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Select  only  those  lines  containing  matches  that  form whole words.  The test is that the matching</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            substring must either be at the beginning of the line, or preceded by a non-word constituent character.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Similarly,  it  must  be either at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent character.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.  This option has no effect  if  -x</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            is also specified.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -x, --line-regexp</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.  For a regular expression pattern, this is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            like parenthesizing the pattern and then surrounding it with ^ and $.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -y     Obsolete synonym for -i.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>General Output Control</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -c, --count</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each  input  file.

The  colors  are  defined by the environment variable GREP_COLORS.  The</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            deprecated environment variable GREP_COLOR is still supported, but its setting does not have  priority.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            WHEN is never, always, or auto.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -L, --files-without-match</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Suppress  normal  output; instead print the name of each input file from which no output would normally</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            have been printed.

The scanning will stop on the first match.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -m NUM, --max-count=NUM</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Stop  reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If the input is standard input from a regular file, and</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            NUM matching lines are output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned  to  just  after  the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            last  matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing context lines.  This enables</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            a calling process to resume a search.  When grep  stops  after  NUM  matching  lines,  it  outputs  any</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            trailing  context  lines.   When  the  -c  or --count option is also used, grep does not output a count</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            greater than NUM.  When the -v or --invert-match option is also used, grep stops after  outputting  NUM</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            non-matching lines.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -o, --only-matching</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Print  only  the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            line.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -q, --quiet, --silent</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.  Exit immediately with zero status  if  any  match  is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            found, even if an error was detected.  Also see the -s or --no-messages option.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -s, --no-messages</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Output Line Prefix Control</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -b, --byte-offset</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Print   the   0-based  byte  offset  within  the  input  file  before  each  line  of  output.   If  -o</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            (--only-matching) is specified, print the offset of the matching part itself.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -H, --with-filename</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Print the file name for each match.  This is the default when there is more than one file to search.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -h, --no-filename</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is the default when there is only  one  file  (or</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            only standard input) to search.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --label=LABEL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Display  input actually coming from standard input as input coming from file LABEL.  This can be useful</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            for commands that transform  a  file's  contents  before  searching,  e.g.,  gzip  -cd  foo.gz  |  grep</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            --label=foo -H 'some pattern'.  See also the -H option.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -n, --line-number</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -T, --initial-tab</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Make  sure that the first character of actual line content lies on a tab stop, so that the alignment of</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            tabs looks normal.  This is useful with options that prefix their output to the actual content:  -H,-n,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            and  -b.   In order to improve the probability that lines from a single file will all start at the same</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            column, this also causes the line number and byte offset (if present) to be printed in a  minimum  size</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            field width.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -u, --unix-byte-offsets</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Report  Unix-style  byte offsets.  This switch causes grep to report byte offsets as if the file were a</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Unix-style text file, i.e., with CR characters stripped off.  This will produce  results  identical  to</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            running  grep  on  a  Unix machine.  This option has no effect unless -b option is also used; it has no</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -Z, --null</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the character  that  normally  follows  a  file</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            name.   For  example,  grep  -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file name instead of the usual newline.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            This option makes the output unambiguous, even  in  the  presence  of  file  names  containing  unusual</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            characters  like  newlines.  This option can be used with commands like find -print0, perl -0, sort -z,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            and xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Context Line Control</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -A NUM, --after-context=NUM</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.  Places a line containing a  group  separator</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            (--)  between  contiguous groups of matches.  With the -o or --only-matching option, this has no effect</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            and a warning is given.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -B NUM, --before-context=NUM</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Print NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.  Places a line containing a  group  separator</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            (--)  between  contiguous groups of matches.  With the -o or --only-matching option, this has no effect</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            and a warning is given.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -C NUM, -NUM, --context=NUM</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Print NUM lines of output context.  Places a line containing a group separator (--) between  contiguous</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            groups of matches.  With the -o or --only-matching option, this has no effect and a warning is given.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>File and Directory Selection</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -a, --text</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the --binary-files=text option.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --binary-files=TYPE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            If  a  file's  data or metadata indicate that the file contains binary data, assume that the file is of</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            type TYPE.  Non-text bytes indicate binary data; these are either  output  bytes  that  are  improperly</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            encoded for the current locale, or null input bytes when the -z option is not given.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            By  default, TYPE is binary, and grep suppresses output after null input binary data is discovered, and</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            suppresses output lines that contain improperly encoded data.  When some  output  is  suppressed,  grep</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            follows any output with a one-line message saying that a binary file matches.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            If  TYPE  is  without-match, when grep discovers null input binary data it assumes that the rest of the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            file does not match; this is equivalent to the -I option.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            If TYPE is text, grep processes a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the -a option.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            When type is binary, grep may treat non-text bytes as line terminators  even  without  the  -z  option.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            This  means choosing binary versus text can affect whether a pattern matches a file.  For example, when</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            type is binary the pattern q$ might match q immediately followed by a null byte, even  though  this  is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            not  matched when type is text.  Conversely, when type is binary the pattern . (period) might not match</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            a null byte.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Warning: The -a option might output binary garbage, which can have nasty side effects if the output  is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            a  terminal  and  if  the  terminal  driver interprets some of it as commands.  On the other hand, when</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            reading files whose text encodings are unknown, it can be helpful to use -a or to set LC_ALL='C' in the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            environment, in order to find more matches even if the matches are unsafe for direct display.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -D ACTION, --devices=ACTION</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            If  an  input  file is a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to process it.  By default, ACTION is read,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            which means that devices are read just as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip, devices  are</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            silently skipped.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            If  an  input  file  is  a directory, use ACTION to process it.  By default, ACTION is read, i.e., read</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            directories just as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip,  silently  skip  directories.   If</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            ACTION  is  recurse, read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            they are on the command line.  This is equivalent to the -r option.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --exclude=GLOB</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Skip any command-line file with a name suffix that matches the pattern GLOB, using wildcard matching; a</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            name  suffix  is  either  the  whole  name,  or  a trailing part that starts with a non-slash character</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            immediately after a slash (/) in the name.  When searching recursively, skip  any  subfile  whose  base</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            name  matches  GLOB; the base name is the part after the last slash.  A pattern can use *, ?, and [...]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            as wildcards, and \\ to quote a wildcard or backslash character literally.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --exclude-from=FILE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Skip files whose base name matches any of the file-name globs read from FILE (using  wildcard  matching</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            as described under --exclude).</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --exclude-dir=GLOB</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Skip  any  command-line  directory  with  a  name suffix that matches the pattern GLOB.  When searching</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            recursively, skip any subdirectory whose base name matches GLOB.  Ignore any redundant trailing slashes</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            in GLOB.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -I     Process  a  binary  file  as  if  it  did  not  contain  matching  data;  this  is  equivalent  to  the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            --binary-files=without-match option.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --include=GLOB</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Search only files whose base name matches GLOB (using wildcard matching as described under  --exclude).</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            If  contradictory  --include  and  --exclude  options  are  given,  the  last matching one wins.  If no</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            --include or --exclude options match, a file is included unless the first such option is --include.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -r, --recursive</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only  if  they  are  on  the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            command  line.   Note  that  if no file operand is given, grep searches the working directory.  This is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            equivalent to the -d recurse option.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -R, --dereference-recursive</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Read all files under each directory, recursively.

This can cause a performance penalty.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -U, --binary</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Treat the file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows, grep guesses whether a  file  is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            text or binary as described for the --binary-files option.  If grep decides the file is a text file, it</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            strips the CR characters from the original file contents (to make regular expressions with ^ and $ work</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            correctly).   Specifying  -U  overrules  this guesswork, causing all files to be read and passed to the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line,  this</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            will  cause some regular expressions to fail.  This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            and MS-Windows.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    -z, --null-data</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Treat input and output data as sequences of lines, each terminated  by  a  zero  byte  (the  ASCII  NUL</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            character)  instead  of a newline.  Like the -Z or --null option, this option can be used with commands</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            like sort -z to process arbitrary file names.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    A regular expression is a pattern that describes a  set  of  strings.   Regular  expressions  are  constructed</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    analogously to arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    grep  understands  three  different versions of regular expression syntax: “basic” (BRE), “extended” (ERE) and</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    “perl” (PCRE).  In GNU grep there is no difference in  available  functionality  between  basic  and  extended</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    syntaxes.   In  other implementations, basic regular expressions are less powerful.  The following description</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    applies to extended regular expressions; differences for basic regular expressions are summarized  afterwards.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    Perl-compatible  regular  expressions  give  additional functionality, and are documented in pcresyntax(3) and</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    pcrepattern(3), but work only if PCRE is available in the system.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character.   Most  characters,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    including  all  letters  and  digits,  are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any meta-character with</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    The period . matches any single character.  It is unspecified whether it matches an encoding error.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Character Classes and Bracket Expressions</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by [ and ].  It matches any  single  character  in  that</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    list.   If the first character of the list is the caret ^ then it matches any character not in the list; it is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    unspecified whether it matches an encoding error.  For example, the regular  expression  [0123456789]  matches</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    any single digit.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    Within  a bracket expression, a range expression consists of two characters separated by a hyphen.  It matches</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's  collating  sequence</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    and  character  set.   For example, in the default C locale, [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd].  Many locales sort</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    characters in dictionary order, and in these locales [a-d] is typically not equivalent to [abcd]; it might  be</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    equivalent  to  [aBbCcDd],  for example.  To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    can use the C locale by setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the value C.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within bracket  expressions,  as  follows.   Their</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    names  are  self  explanatory,  and they are [:alnum:], [:alpha:], [:blank:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:],</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    [:lower:], [:print:], [:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], and [:xdigit:].  For  example,  [[:alnum:]]  means  the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    character  class  of  numbers  and  letters  in  the  current locale.  In the C locale and ASCII character set</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    encoding, this is the same as [0-9A-Za-z].  (Note that the brackets in these  class  names  are  part  of  the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    symbolic  names,  and  must  be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket expression.)  Most</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    meta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions.  To include a literal ] place it  first</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    in  the list.  Similarly, to include a literal ^ place it anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a literal -</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    place it last.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Anchoring</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are  meta-characters  that  respectively  match  the  empty  string  at  the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    beginning and end of a line.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>The Backslash Character and Special Expressions</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    The  symbols  \\&#x3C; and \\> respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word.  The symbol \\b</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    matches the empty string at the edge of a word, and \\B matches the empty string provided it's not at the  edge</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    of a word.  The symbol \\w is a synonym for [_[:alnum:]] and \\W is a synonym for [^_[:alnum:]].</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Repetition</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    ?      The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    *      The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    +      The preceding item will be matched one or more times.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    {n}    The preceding item is matched exactly n times.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    {n,}   The preceding item is matched n or more times.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    {,m}   The preceding item is matched at most m times.  This is a GNU extension.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    {n,m}  The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Concatenation</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    Two  regular  expressions  may  be concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any string formed by</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    concatenating two substrings that respectively match the concatenated expressions.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Alternation</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator |; the resulting regular  expression  matches  any</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    string matching either alternate expression.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Precedence</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    Repetition  takes  precedence  over  concatenation,  which in turn takes precedence over alternation.  A whole</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    expression may be enclosed in parentheses to override these precedence rules and form a subexpression.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Back-references and Subexpressions</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    The back-reference \\n, where n is a single  digit,  matches  the  substring  previously  matched  by  the  nth</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    parenthesized subexpression of the regular expression.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    In  basic regular expressions the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (, and ) lose their special meaning; instead use</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    the backslashed versions \\?, \\+, \\{, \\|, \\(, and \\).</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>EXIT STATUS</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    Normally the exit status is 0 if a line is selected, 1 if no lines were selected, and 2 if an error  occurred.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    However,  if  the  -q  or  --quiet or --silent is used and a line is selected, the exit status is 0 even if an</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    error occurred.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>ENVIRONMENT</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    The behavior of grep is affected by the following environment variables.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    The locale for category LC_foo is specified by examining the three environment variables LC_ALL, LC_foo, LANG,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    in  that order.  The first of these variables that is set specifies the locale.  For example, if LC_ALL is not</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    set, but LC_MESSAGES is set to pt_BR, then the  Brazilian  Portuguese  locale  is  used  for  the  LC_MESSAGES</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    category.   The  C locale is used if none of these environment variables are set, if the locale catalog is not</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    installed, or if grep was not compiled with national language support (NLS).   The  shell  command  locale  -a</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    lists locales that are currently available.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    GREP_COLOR</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            This  variable  specifies  the  color  used to highlight matched (non-empty) text.  It is deprecated in</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            favor of GREP_COLORS, but still supported.  The  mt,  ms,  and  mc  capabilities  of  GREP_COLORS  have</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            priority  over  it.  It can only specify the color used to highlight the matching non-empty text in any</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            matching line (a selected line when the -v command-line option is omitted, or a context line when -v is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            specified).   The  default  is  01;31, which means a bold red foreground text on the terminal's default</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            background.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    GREP_COLORS</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            Specifies the colors and other attributes used to highlight various parts of the output.  Its value  is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            a        colon-separated        list        of        capabilities        that        defaults       to</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36 with the  rv  and  ne  boolean  capabilities  omitted</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            (i.e., false).  Supported capabilities are as follows.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            sl=    SGR  substring for whole selected lines (i.e., matching lines when the -v command-line option is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    omitted, or non-matching lines when -v is specified).  If however the boolean rv capability  and</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    the  -v  command-line  option  are both specified, it applies to context matching lines instead.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            cx=    SGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-matching lines when the -v command-line  option</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    is  omitted,  or matching lines when -v is specified).  If however the boolean rv capability and</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    the -v command-line option are  both  specified,  it  applies  to  selected  non-matching  lines</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    instead.  The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            rv     Boolean  value  that  reverses  (swaps) the meanings of the sl= and cx= capabilities when the -v</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    command-line option is specified.  The default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            mt=01;31</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any matching line (i.e., a selected line  when  the</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    -v  command-line  option  is  omitted, or a context line when -v is specified).  Setting this is</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    equivalent to setting both ms= and mc= at once to the same value.  The default  is  a  bold  red</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    text foreground over the current line background.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            ms=01;31</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    SGR  substring  for  matching non-empty text in a selected line.  (This is only used when the -v</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    command-line option is omitted.)  The effect of the sl= (or cx= if rv) capability remains active</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    when this kicks in.  The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            mc=01;31</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    SGR  substring  for  matching  non-empty text in a context line.  (This is only used when the -v</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    command-line option is specified.)  The effect of the cx= (or  sl=  if  rv)  capability  remains</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    active  when  this  kicks  in.   The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>                    background.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            fn=35  SGR substring for file names prefixing  any  content  line.

A regex expression is a form of pattern matching. For the purpose of this article we will skip the regex tutorial.</p>\n<p>Here are some basics for a recap.</p>\n<h3 id=\"anchors\">Anchors</h3>\n<p>These are expressions that signify a position as a condition. Using one of these means that for there to be a match then you must find the particular phrase in the required position. For example, when we use <code>^</code> we are signifying that the phrase after it must be at the beginning of any match. Say <code>^c</code> would be true for <code>chris</code> but would be false for <code>back</code>. In the first case we have the word <code>chris</code> which begins with a c. This provides a match and thus is true for the regex of <code>^c</code>. Since <code>back</code> only contains a c at the end it does not satisfy the case of <code>^c</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<table><thead><tr><th>Expression</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>^[exp]</td><td>Start</td><td>^a  - “Hola <u><strong>a</strong></u>migo”</td></tr><tr><td>\\A[exp]</td><td>Start</td><td>\\Aa - “Hola <u><strong>a</strong></u>migo”</td></tr><tr><td>[exp]$</td><td>End</td><td>d$  - “Hello Worl<u><strong>d</strong></u>”</td></tr><tr><td>[exp]\\Z</td><td>End</td><td>d\\Z - “Hello Worl<u><strong>d</strong></u>”</td></tr><tr><td>\\b[exp]\\b</td><td>Word Boundary</td><td>\\bme\\b - “<u><strong>me</strong></u> not some”</td></tr><tr><td>\\B[exp]\\B</td><td>Not Word Boundary</td><td>\\Bme\\B - “Ho<u><strong>me</strong></u>r not me or some”</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><em>Note: The use of [exp] is designed to represent a standalone expression. This should not be confused wtih the actual brackets notation.</em></p>\n<p>Let’s look at those work boudaries. They are a bit strange but useful. If a word is a group of letters then a word boundary is the edge of that word. In other words, a letter next to a space would be a word boundary. <code>/b</code> is a word boundary. The side of the expression you apply /b to is the side of the expression that you want a boundary on. If both side have a boundary then you can safely say you are looking for an exact word match. This looks like <code>/bword\\b</code>. If we want a phrase that ends with an expression then we can use <code>[exp]\\b</code>.</p>\n<p>TODO: add some examples of these being demonstrated in the console.

Windows aliased update to upgrade. What is the difference and why is it not the same thing?\r\n\r\nDebian's package manager apt has a 3 part update process. You update the package manager's information on the packages with `update`, then use that to update the packages themselves with `upgrade`, and finally you tidy up unneeded packages with `autoremove`.\r\n\r\n\r\n``` \r\nupdate (apt-get(8))\r\n    update is used to download package information from all configured sources. Other commands operate on this\r\n    data to e.g. perform package upgrades or search in and display details about all packages available for\r\n    installation.\r\n```\r\nUpdate is their verbage to update the package manager's knowlege of the packages you have installed. It updates the package manager, not the packages.\r\n\r\n```\r\nupgrade (apt-get(8))\r\n    upgrade is used to install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system from the\r\n    sources configured via sources.list(5).

If an upgrade for a package requires the\r\n    removal of an installed package the upgrade for this package isn't performed.\r\n```\r\nUpgrade is used when you want to upgrade/update your packages. It installs the new version of the package and grabs any new dependencies. It doesn't remove any outdated or unused dependenies however so you may want to run autoremove.\r\n\r\n```\r\nautoremove (apt-get(8))\r\n    autoremove is used to remove packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other\r\n    packages and are now no longer needed as dependencies changed or the package(s) needing them were removed\r\n    in the meantime.\r\n\r\n    You should check that the list does not include applications you have grown to like even though they were\r\n    once installed just as a dependency of another package. You can mark such a package as manually installed\r\n    by using apt-mark(8). Packages which you have installed explicitly via install are also never proposed for\r\n           automatic removal.\r\n```\r\nAutoremove removes dependency packages you don't need anymore. If the package is an app that you don't want to have removed you can mark it, or just reinstall it to keep it. \r\n\r\nBack in the day, when I started using fedora, the package manager was YUM.

That being said, updates can be very important for security reasons as they carry patches to security holes and fixes to bugs.\r\n\r\nA more modern advantage of linux updates is that you don't get advertisements for products from the maker of the OS with every update. No Microsoft, I don't want to sign up for 365 for 50% off.

Winget will try to run the installer instead of just installing. Windows doesn't usually handle packages like linux does. For most distros you hava a package manager that installs all of the software.\r\nOf course it would make sense for the same package manager to update the software it installed. \r\nIn Windows we use separate installers. In fact, there are a few different type of installers. There are .msi and .msix files that install the program.\r\nThere are also portable apps that don't require installation. Either way, how do we now control the installation?\r\nWe download and run the installer and automate the process.\r\n\r\nSo you can update apps easily but the OS itself will still give you the hard rebooting, advertisement pushing, classic Microsoft updates.","src/content/blog/linux_commands/updates.md","e5c0ca533e48c4d9",{html:377,metadata:378},"<h2 id=\"how-to-update-most-distros\">How to update most distros</h2>\n<p>One of the main advantages of linux over windows is that the update process can be much much easier and smoother than on windows.\r\nI’ve had Windows unexpectedly restart in the middle of a movie, while I was sleeping, while downloading files and just about any other inconveinient time.</p>\n<p>So if you have been using pretty much any distro of linux then you have propbably performed and update.</p>\n<p>Debian has <code>sudo apt update &#x26;&#x26; sudo apt upgrade</code>. <br>\r\nFedora has <code>sudo dnf upgrade</code>. <br>\r\nArch has <code>pacman -Syu</code>. <br></p>\n<p>If you trust windows package manager then you can even do <code>winget upgrade --all</code>.\r\nIt also happens to be aliased as <code>winget update --all</code>, incase that feels more comfortable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-is-the-difference-between-an-upgrade-and-an-update\">So what is the difference between an upgrade and an update?</h2>\n<p>As you can see, Debian has an update and upgrade command.

For most distros you hava a package manager that installs all of the software.\r\nOf course it would make sense for the same package manager to update the software it installed.\r\nIn Windows we use separate installers. In fact, there are a few different type of installers. There are .msi and .msix files that install the program.\r\nThere are also portable apps that don’t require installation. Either way, how do we now control the installation?\r\nWe download and run the installer and automate the process.</p>\n<p>So you can update apps easily but the OS itself will still give you the hard rebooting, advertisement pushing, classic Microsoft updates.</p>",{headings:379,localImagePaths:392,remoteImagePaths:393,frontmatter:394,imagePaths:395},[380,383,386,389],{depth:40,slug:381,text:382},"how-to-update-most-distros","How to update most distros",{depth:40,slug:384,text:385},"so-what-is-the-difference-between-an-upgrade-and-an-update","So what is the difference between an upgrade and an update?",{depth:40,slug:387,text:388},"the-advantage","The advantage",{depth:40,slug:390,text:391},"microsofts-version","Microsoft’s version",[],[],{title:371,description:371,author:294,draft:30,category:344,pubDate:295},[],"linux_commands/updates.md","pong/pong",{id:397,data:399,body:402,filePath:403,digest:404,rendered:405,legacyId:441},{title:400,description:401,draft:23},"Building Pong","Building pong using Typescript, CSS, and SVGs","## What is Pong?\r\n\r\nPong is an electronic game of tennis, so to speak. It was released by Atari in 1972. While the first electronic version of tennis was a game called Tennis for Two, dating back to 1958, Pong was one of the first mainstream video games to appear in arcade cabinet form.\r\n\r\nPong is a game that consists of 2 players, each equipped with a paddle. The goal is to bounce the ball off of your paddle so it doesn't go out of bounds on your side. You score points for every ball you hit over the other players side of the court. \r\n\r\n## The basics\r\n\r\nIn our version of Pong we will be using the web browser and Typescript to code the game.\r\nThe first step is setting up a HTML file with the appropriate link to the converted Javascript file. \r\nBut I thought you said we were using Typescript?  We are, but most browsers can't run Typescript natively.\r\nBy converting the Typescript (.ts) file into Javascript (.js) we create something that the browser can interpret. \r\n\r\nWe will also need to include links to out CSS file as well as create a SVG with elements for our board, ball, paddles, and score.\r\n\r\nAn SVG?\r\n\r\nYes that. \r\n\r\nAn SVG is a Scalable Vector Graphics format that makes images out of elements similar to HTML. It can also use complex math to make shapes. \r\n\r\nSo why an SVG instead of a JPG or PNG?\r\n\r\nSVG allows for us to define the elements of the board and all game pieces as well as manipulate their positions. \r\nBeing able to do this directly is much easier that importing multiple images for each part of the game board. \r\nIt also allows us to practice SVG manipulation, which can be an essential skill for Frontend Development.\r\n\r\n## Game logic\r\n\r\nThis can be broken into a few major parts. There's the game engine which is the main loop that repeats until game over.\r\nThere's the input handler, which checks for input from the user moves the paddles.\r\nThere's the ball which moves based on a velocity along the x and y axis. \r\nThe movement is handled in the game loop but the trajectory is calculated upon impact.\r\nThere's the bounds detection / collision detection which handles any contact with the ball.\r\nAnd finally there is a \"AI\" component for the player to play against in single player.\r\n\r\nThe input handler, collision detection, and score are all called from the game loop once per loop. \r\nThis ensures that every frame is accurate and responsive.\r\n\r\n**I might add an await to the input handler and make it asynchronous for responsiveness.**\r\n\r\nThe logic is simple, if the ball hits a paddle or the top or bottom wall then it bounces, otherwise it is a point for the opposite side.\r\nOnce the ball is out of bounds and the point is score it should be reset and cast toward the opposing team.\r\n\r\n### Collision Detection\r\n\r\nCollision detection should be performed on movement since this is the only time that collision could happen. \r\nLogically speaking, collision can only happen after a movement, thus we check after each movement or frame update.\r\n\r\n#### Box collision\r\n\r\nIf we think of the ball and paddles as a box then we can see if the balls outer most point is in conflict with that of the paddles. \r\nA box has a range on the x and y axis. If the left most point on the box is within the range of another object then we have a collision.\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple form of collision detection that can be used on the x and y axis. The limitation being that a curve would require a bit more checking to see if there is in fact a collision. \r\n\r\n#### Bounds Collision\r\n\r\nUsing the same box collision for the ball and a fixed x and y position, we can figure out if the ball is in bounds or not. \r\nIf we set the game board as starting at 0,0 and ending at 100,100 and we have a ball that is 5 in size then we can check for collisions. \r\nFor instance, if the ball is at position 99,20 then we can say that there is a collision on the right side since 99+5 is 104 and is outside of the bounds of the board.\r\n\r\n#### Directional Collision Detection\r\n\r\nSince we know the direction of the ball's movement we only need to check for collisions on the side of the direction of travel. If we are moving to the left, then there is no need to check for collision on the right side. \r\nThe ball moves to the right on a left collision with the paddle, thus we no longer need to check the left side while moving towards the right. \r\nFor simplicity, collision detection should only check on the directions of motion of any object.\r\n\r\n#### Collision Detection Function\r\n\r\nWe need to pass in the direction of travel, the range on the x and the range of the y of the object, and the x and y range of any object to be tested against. \r\n\r\nThis could look something like \r\n```detect( direction, objectX, objectY, paddleX, paddleY)```\r\n\r\nSince the paddles have a fixed x location and a varying y location, we can also forgo the paddleX.\r\n``` detect( direction, objectX, objectY, paddleLeftY, paddleRightY ) ```\r\n\r\nThis can use the direction to check for the left or right paddle. This might seem a bit wasteful though sending needless information through.\r\n\r\nWe could also use  `detect( object1X, object1Y, object2X, object2Y )`, which would be more generic and slightly less efficient. \r\n\r\nHow about ``` detect( direction, object1COORD, object2COORD ) ```?\r\nThis still passes in unused information, however, we can treat the COORD positions as a tuple type and keep the information useful since it has to exist anyway. \r\n\r\n### Score\r\n\r\nSince we know how collision detextion works, we can then set the logic to trigger a score event into the collision detection. \r\n\r\nThe collision detection on the left and right bounds need to trigger a score for the right or left player respectively.\r\nSo basically we can add logic that the ball going out of the right bounds would score a point for the left player. This would then trigger a score update, thus incrementing the plaer's score by a predetermined amount.\r\n\r\nSince our score is updating, it also makes sense to call a function to redraw or update the score.","src/content/blog/pong/pong.md","081e2ed93d8660cc",{html:406,metadata:407},"<h2 id=\"what-is-pong\">What is Pong?</h2>\n<p>Pong is an electronic game of tennis, so to speak.

The goal of the game is hard to explain as it depends on the player.\r\nThis game is a cyberpunk style text based rpg, rouge-like, idler. What the heck does that mean? It is a cyberpunk themed game that is set in the year 2077. It has RPG elements such as stats that you rank up. It is an idler in the sense that you will have times in which it is best to just let the game go while you sleep since there is quiet a bit of automation in the game. \r\nYour The goal is to make money and level up in game through challenges that can be solved with code. \r\nThe basic mechanics of making money are hacknets( automated servers that earn you money ), hacking servers, working ( for companies or factions ), crime, the stock market, and infiltration. \r\nThe game is designed to teach basic computer science topics such as how to use a unix-like terminal and basic programming in JavaScript.\r\nIt is hard to talk about the game without giving out spoilers. Luckily there is not a ton of plot to the game and what lore there is about the Bit burner universe can be found through exploring the servers in-game. \r\nThis game has a trend where it introduces new challenges as soon as you have solved the current ones.\r\n\r\n## Basic Gameplay\r\n\r\nThe basics of the game are learning how to navigate, unlock and hack the servers. This is the main mechanic of the game.\r\n\r\n### Navigation\r\n\r\nNavigating to a specific server is easy enough. You start at \"home\" and can move to any server that is connected to \"home\". To see which servers you can connect to you can run `scan` or `scan-analyze`.\r\n\r\nLet's say that we want to see all available servers to connect to. We type in `scan` and get the following: \r\n```\r\nhome /]> scan\r\nHostname        IP       Root Access\r\nn00dles         0.8.2.0  N\r\nfoodnstuff      57.5.5.0 N\r\nsigma-cosmetics 94.9.2.4 N\r\njoesguns        7.3.0.9  N\r\nhong-fang-tea   47.4.2.5 N\r\nharakiri-sushi  69.6.1.3 N\r\niron-gym        9.5.3.2  N\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo move to another server you use the `connect` command.\r\n\r\nLet's connect to n00dles using `connect n00dles`.\r\n\r\nFrom there we can scan and see any available servers to connect to.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[n00dles /]> scan\r\nHostname IP       Root Access\r\nhome     87.5.5.1 Y\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see there is nothing else connected to n00dles besides home.\r\n\r\nTo return home from anywhere we can type `home` and press enter.\r\n\r\nLet's say that we want to see what is connected to another server without having to connect to it. We can use `scan-analyze [i]` where i is a depth. By default we can go to a depth of 3. With each level up of `Deepscan` you will get a higher level of depth you can scan.\r\n\r\nIf you want to scan grom home you can `scan-analyze 3` and see the network to the 3rd level.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[home /]> scan-analyze 3\r\n┗ home\r\n  ┃   Root Access: YES, Required hacking skill: 1\r\n  ┃   Number of open ports required to NUKE: 5\r\n  ┃   RAM: 256.00GB\r\n  ┣ n00dles\r\n  ┃     Root Access: NO, Required hacking skill: 1\r\n  ┃     Number of open ports required to NUKE: 0\r\n  ┃     RAM: 4.00GB\r\n  ┣ foodnstuff\r\n  ┃ ┃   Root Access: NO, Required hacking skill: 1\r\n  ┃ ┃   Number of open ports required to NUKE: 0\r\n  ┃ ┃   RAM: 16.00GB\r\n  ┃ ┗ zer0\r\n  ┃   ┃   Root Access: NO, Required hacking skill: 75\r\n  ┃   ┃   Number of open ports required to NUKE: 1\r\n  ┃   ┃   RAM: 32.00GB\r\n  ┃   ┗ silver-helix\r\n  ┃         Root Access: NO, Required hacking skill: 150\r\n  ┃         Number of open ports required to NUKE: 2\r\n  ┃         RAM: 64.00GB\r\n  ...\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nAs we can see from this example, there is nothing connected past n00dles, however, there are servers connected to foodnstuff that we can't access directly from home. To connect to these we can first connect to foodnstuff and then connect to `zer0` and then `silver-helix`.\r\n\r\nLater in the game when you acquire `AutoLink.exe` you can simply click on the server from the `scan-analyze` output to go directly to that server. This is a huge time saver and is worth the initial time used to gain `AutoLink.exe`.\r\n\r\n### Hacking\r\n\r\nThe most basic way to hack a server is to connect to it and simply type in `hack`. The same goes for weakening and growing a server. You can only hack a server if you have root access and your hacking level is greater than what is required from the server. The first server we can hack is `n00dles`.\r\n\r\nWhere the game gets interesting is the ability to write scripts that can perform these tasks for you, we'll talk more about that later.\r\n\r\nWhen you hack a server you increase the server's security level and decrease the server's available money. To increase the money available you can use `grow` which increases the money available but also the security level. To reduce the security level you can use the `weaken` command.\r\n\r\nIt is common practice to use `weaken` after each hack or grow command as needed.\r\n\r\nThe challenging part is that each command will take a different amount of time to execute. For example we use the hack command to gain money from `n00dles`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[n00dles /]> hack\r\n[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]\r\nHack successful on 'n00dles'! Gained $190.000 and 1.701 hacking exp\r\nSecurity increased on 'n00dles' from 1.000 to 1.002\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that we have gained $190 and 1.701 hacking exp but have also increased the security. While this is a small increase in security we will still demonstrate how the `weaken` command works.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[n00dles /]> weaken\r\n[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]\r\nSecurity decreased on 'n00dles' by 0.050 from 1.004 to 1.000 (min: 1.000) and Gained 1.701 hacking exp.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we can see that the security level of `n00dles` is back down to it's minimum level of 1 and that we also gained the same amount of hacking exp.\r\nWhat you can't see here is that the `weaken` command took longer to execute than the `hack` command.\r\nThis intruduces a time strategy that we must overcome later on.\r\n\r\nYou can continue to hack and weaken a server until the money is depleted. To avoid this you use the `grow` command. \r\n\r\n```\r\n[n00dles /]> grow\r\n[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]\r\nAvailable money on 'n00dles' grown by 0.000000%. Gained 1.701 hacking exp.\r\nSecurity increased on 'n00dles' from 1.004 to 1.004\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command usually takes a time that is in betweem hack and grow to complete. It also increases the security of the server. For smaller servers like this we can honestly perform a hack and grow before the weaken and still have the same results.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[n00dles /]> hack\r\n[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]\r\nHack successful on 'n00dles'! Gained $189.000 and 1.701 hacking exp\r\nSecurity increased on 'n00dles' from 1.002 to 1.004\r\n[n00dles /]> grow\r\n[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]\r\nAvailable money on 'n00dles' grown by 0.289910%. Gained 1.701 hacking exp.\r\nSecurity increased on 'n00dles' from 1.004 to 1.008\r\n[n00dles /]> weaken\r\n[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]\r\nSecurity decreased on 'n00dles' by 0.050 from 1.000 to 1.000 (min: 1.000) and Gained 1.701 hacking exp.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example we can see that the amount the security was raised from both the `hack` and `grow` was completely removed by the `weaken`. This strategy is known as `HGW` for hack grow weaken.\r\n\r\n### Scripting\r\n\r\nThe scripting portion of the game is the real bread and butter, the meat and potatoes, the main kit and caboodle. The purpose of this game is to help people learn coding concepts in a fun way. The scripting language they use is a beginner friendly version of JavaScript called Netscript.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever written JavaScript, ECMAscript, TypeScript, or any of the other JS variants then you will be quite adept in scripting in this game. The game gives you a basic editor styled after either vim or nano, with much of the \"intellisense\" style autocompletions and suggestions. \r\nThe games suggestions are a nice touch as it gives a similar popup style tooltip that let's you see the documentation of the Netscript libraries. This gets you started quickly so you don't have to spend your time reading documentation.\r\n\r\nThe game has a built-in library called NS.\r\n<br/>NS is the basic functionality for the game. It includes the hack, weaken, and grow functions. \r\n\r\n**For a full list of the basic Netscript functions look [here](https://bitburner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/netscript/netscriptfunctions.html)**  \r\n\r\nLater in the game you will get to the bladeburner portion of scripting where you can control the purchase of servers and joining factions.

The goal of the game is hard to explain as it depends on the player.\r\nThis game is a cyberpunk style text based rpg, rouge-like, idler. What the heck does that mean? It is a cyberpunk themed game that is set in the year 2077. It has RPG elements such as stats that you rank up. It is an idler in the sense that you will have times in which it is best to just let the game go while you sleep since there is quiet a bit of automation in the game.\r\nYour The goal is to make money and level up in game through challenges that can be solved with code.\r\nThe basic mechanics of making money are hacknets( automated servers that earn you money ), hacking servers, working ( for companies or factions ), crime, the stock market, and infiltration.\r\nThe game is designed to teach basic computer science topics such as how to use a unix-like terminal and basic programming in JavaScript.\r\nIt is hard to talk about the game without giving out spoilers. Luckily there is not a ton of plot to the game and what lore there is about the Bit burner universe can be found through exploring the servers in-game.\r\nThis game has a trend where it introduces new challenges as soon as you have solved the current ones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"basic-gameplay\">Basic Gameplay</h2>\n<p>The basics of the game are learning how to navigate, unlock and hack the servers. This is the main mechanic of the game.</p>\n<h3 id=\"navigation\">Navigation</h3>\n<p>Navigating to a specific server is easy enough. You start at “home” and can move to any server that is connected to “home”. To see which servers you can connect to you can run <code>scan</code> or <code>scan-analyze</code>.</p>\n<p>Let’s say that we want to see all available servers to connect to. We type in <code>scan</code> and get the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>home /]> scan</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Hostname        IP       Root Access</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>n00dles         0.8.2.0  N</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>foodnstuff      57.5.5.0 N</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>sigma-cosmetics 94.9.2.4 N</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>joesguns        7.3.0.9  N</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>hong-fang-tea   47.4.2.5 N</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>harakiri-sushi  69.6.1.3 N</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>iron-gym        9.5.3.2  N</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>To move to another server you use the <code>connect</code> command.</p>\n<p>Let’s connect to n00dles using <code>connect n00dles</code>.</p>\n<p>From there we can scan and see any available servers to connect to.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>[n00dles /]> scan</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Hostname IP       Root Access</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>home     87.5.5.1 Y</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>As we can see there is nothing else connected to n00dles besides home.</p>\n<p>To return home from anywhere we can type <code>home</code> and press enter.</p>\n<p>Let’s say that we want to see what is connected to another server without having to connect to it. We can use <code>scan-analyze [i]</code> where i is a depth. By default we can go to a depth of 3. With each level up of <code>Deepscan</code> you will get a higher level of depth you can scan.</p>\n<p>If you want to scan grom home you can <code>scan-analyze 3</code> and see the network to the 3rd level.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>[home /]> scan-analyze 3</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>┗ home</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃   Root Access: YES, Required hacking skill: 1</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃   Number of open ports required to NUKE: 5</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃   RAM: 256.00GB</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┣ n00dles</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃     Root Access: NO, Required hacking skill: 1</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃     Number of open ports required to NUKE: 0</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃     RAM: 4.00GB</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┣ foodnstuff</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃ ┃   Root Access: NO, Required hacking skill: 1</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃ ┃   Number of open ports required to NUKE: 0</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃ ┃   RAM: 16.00GB</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃ ┗ zer0</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃   ┃   Root Access: NO, Required hacking skill: 75</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃   ┃   Number of open ports required to NUKE: 1</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃   ┃   RAM: 32.00GB</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃   ┗ silver-helix</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃         Root Access: NO, Required hacking skill: 150</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃         Number of open ports required to NUKE: 2</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ┃         RAM: 64.00GB</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>  ...</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>As we can see from this example, there is nothing connected past n00dles, however, there are servers connected to foodnstuff that we can’t access directly from home. To connect to these we can first connect to foodnstuff and then connect to <code>zer0</code> and then <code>silver-helix</code>.</p>\n<p>Later in the game when you acquire <code>AutoLink.exe</code> you can simply click on the server from the <code>scan-analyze</code> output to go directly to that server. This is a huge time saver and is worth the initial time used to gain <code>AutoLink.exe</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hacking\">Hacking</h3>\n<p>The most basic way to hack a server is to connect to it and simply type in <code>hack</code>. The same goes for weakening and growing a server. You can only hack a server if you have root access and your hacking level is greater than what is required from the server. The first server we can hack is <code>n00dles</code>.</p>\n<p>Where the game gets interesting is the ability to write scripts that can perform these tasks for you, we’ll talk more about that later.</p>\n<p>When you hack a server you increase the server’s security level and decrease the server’s available money. To increase the money available you can use <code>grow</code> which increases the money available but also the security level. To reduce the security level you can use the <code>weaken</code> command.</p>\n<p>It is common practice to use <code>weaken</code> after each hack or grow command as needed.</p>\n<p>The challenging part is that each command will take a different amount of time to execute. For example we use the hack command to gain money from <code>n00dles</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>[n00dles /]> hack</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Hack successful on 'n00dles'! Gained $190.000 and 1.701 hacking exp</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Security increased on 'n00dles' from 1.000 to 1.002</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Notice that we have gained $190 and 1.701 hacking exp but have also increased the security. While this is a small increase in security we will still demonstrate how the <code>weaken</code> command works.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>[n00dles /]> weaken</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Security decreased on 'n00dles' by 0.050 from 1.004 to 1.000 (min: 1.000) and Gained 1.701 hacking exp.</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Here we can see that the security level of <code>n00dles</code> is back down to it’s minimum level of 1 and that we also gained the same amount of hacking exp.\r\nWhat you can’t see here is that the <code>weaken</code> command took longer to execute than the <code>hack</code> command.\r\nThis intruduces a time strategy that we must overcome later on.</p>\n<p>You can continue to hack and weaken a server until the money is depleted. To avoid this you use the <code>grow</code> command.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>[n00dles /]> grow</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Available money on 'n00dles' grown by 0.000000%.

It also increases the security of the server. For smaller servers like this we can honestly perform a hack and grow before the weaken and still have the same results.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>[n00dles /]> hack</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>[||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Hack successful on 'n00dles'!

This strategy is known as <code>HGW</code> for hack grow weaken.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scripting\">Scripting</h3>\n<p>The scripting portion of the game is the real bread and butter, the meat and potatoes, the main kit and caboodle. The purpose of this game is to help people learn coding concepts in a fun way. The scripting language they use is a beginner friendly version of JavaScript called Netscript.</p>\n<p>If you have ever written JavaScript, ECMAscript, TypeScript, or any of the other JS variants then you will be quite adept in scripting in this game. The game gives you a basic editor styled after either vim or nano, with much of the “intellisense” style autocompletions and suggestions.\r\nThe games suggestions are a nice touch as it gives a similar popup style tooltip that let’s you see the documentation of the Netscript libraries. This gets you started quickly so you don’t have to spend your time reading documentation.</p>\n<p>The game has a built-in library called NS.\r\n<br>NS is the basic functionality for the game. It includes the hack, weaken, and grow functions.</p>\n<p><strong>For a full list of the basic Netscript functions look <a href=\"https://bitburner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/netscript/netscriptfunctions.html\">here</a></strong></p>\n<p>Later in the game you will get to the bladeburner portion of scripting where you can control the purchase of servers and joining factions. This speeds up late gameplay.\r\nAs I have not reached that part of the game yet I’ll just have to put that into part 2 of this blog.

There are different arrays for different needs; whether it be redundancy, speed, or both. Hardware RAID is not as common as it use to be since ZFS and brtfs both have their own versions with their own benefits and pitfalls.\r\n\r\n## Types of RAID\r\n\r\n| Name    | RAID Type                  | Max Drive Failure | Min number of drives |\r\n| ---     | ---                        |  ---              | ---                  | \r\n| RAID 0  | Striping                   | 0                 | 2                    |\r\n| RAID 1  | Mirroring                  | n-1               | 2                    | \r\n| RAID 5  | Striping and Parity        | 1                 | 3                    |\r\n| RAID 6  | Striping and Double Parity | 2                 | 6                    |\r\n| RAID 10 | Mirroring and Striping     | 1 per array       | 4                    |\r\n\r\n### RAID 0\r\n\r\nRAID 0 is the simplest RAID as it simply stripes the data that is distributed to the drives. \r\nThis means that the data is split between the two drives in order to increase the speed of reads and writes. If you have two drives in RAID 0 then you have a speed that is in theory two times faster. The speed of reads and writes is considered to be n times the speed of a single drive, where n is the number of drives in the array.\r\n\r\nRAID 0 is dangerous as it has zero redundancy. This means that if a single drive fails then so does the entire array. \r\n\r\nRAID 0 is to be used for speed and performance, not long term storage. This is useful for doing large data calculations, where the computer can read and write large sets of data faster. While this doesn't make the calculation faster, it does reduce the time in between calculations, thus increasing performance when making multiple computaitons. \r\n\r\n### RAID 1\r\n\r\nRAID 1 is when the information on a single drive is also writtent to a redundant drive. This array mirrors data and writes it simultaneously to multiple drives, making the write speed the same as the slowest drive. When reading from this array the speed can be as fast as the speed of the drives combined, as it can read the same data from multiple drives at once. \r\nAs long as a single drive in this array is still operable, all of the data should be preserved. This means that you can lose all but 1 drive and be OK.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the safest RAID configurations but it does not offer the same performace gains as RAID 0.\r\n\r\n### RAID 5\r\n\r\nRAID 5 is when striping and parity is used in order to gain speed and maintain some form of safety. In RAID 5 the data is striped across all disks and a parity bit is added for redundancy. This data is used to store the calculation from the XOR of the striped data. This can be used to recalculate and rebuild the array on the loss of a single drive. If more than one drive fails then the information cannot be recalculated. \r\n\r\n### RAID 6\r\n\r\nRAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but there is double the parity data. This means that the parity bits are written to multiple drives and the array can handle up to 2 drive failures. The double parity als means that the array is more likily to succeed on a rebuild after a failure.\r\n\r\n### RAID 10\r\n\r\nRAID 10 is actually RAID 1 + 0. It is a combination of RAID 1's mirroring process as well as the striping process of RAID 0. This offers both speed and reliability. The downside is that it requires twice as many drives to acheive the same storage as a simple RAID 0 and is also slower since it has to mirror the data from the array. The benefits are the increased speed over RAID 1 as well as the ability to withstand a drive failure unlike RAID 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Which RAID should I use?\r\n\r\nThat all depends on your needs. If you need a fast read and write and aren't worried about data loss then RAID 0 just might be for you. Perhaps you need speed but also value your data, in that case there is RAID 10. It offers speed gains like RAID 0 with the data mirroring of RAID 1. \r\n\r\nMaybe you want a large data pool for a server, RAID 5 might be useful as it allows you to combine size and speed of drives at the cost of the CPU. Since server processors are often built for this use case they are better equippewd for this work load than desktop processors. \r\nCare more about your data, then RAID 6 might be useful as it offers many of the beneifts of 5 with an added set of parity information. This means rebuilds are more likily to succeed and more drives can fail. This makes it good for data servers or movie libraries, as data integrity is appreciated. \r\n\r\n## ZFS\r\n\r\n### What is ZFS and how it works\r\n\r\nZFS is a file system that was made by Sun Microsystems for use on Solaris. It stands for *Z*ettabyte *F*ile *S*ystem and was designed to deal with larger files and capacities. \r\n\r\nZFS has since been adopted by freeNAS and has many RAID configurations. \r\n\r\nRAID 0 is considered a striped VDev. RAID 1 is acheived by mirroring the VDevs. RAID 5 is considered RAIDZ1, RAID 6 is RAIDZ2 and RAIDZ3 is just a continuation of the pattern with 3 parity block instead of 2.","src/content/blog/APlusTerms/Hardware/RAID.md","96360f92bcf81ae4",{html:485,metadata:486},"<h2 id=\"what-is-raid\">What is RAID?</h2>\n<p>RAID, or Redundant Array of Independent Disks, is a way for configuring your storage devices.

Whether you are connecting IOT, computers, wireless devices, or anything in between; there is a network type that is ideal for each occation.\r\n\r\nThe main network types are:\r\n1) Persona Area Network (PAN)\r\n2) Local Area Network (LAN)\r\n3) Metropolatan Area Network (MAN)\r\n4) Wide Area Network (WAN)\r\n\r\nAmong there there are sub categories and specialty networks such as Storage Area Network (SAN) and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).\r\n\r\n### Personal Area Network (PAN)\r\n \r\nThis is a form of network that is between a small number of devices and has limited range. Think of bluetooth from you phone to your speaker, your controller to your game console, your remote to your TV, your watch to your phone, your mouse to your computer and so on and so forth. When there is a connection between peripherals or smaller devices there is usually a PAN.\r\n\r\n### Local Area Network (LAN)\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most common forms of networks. It describes a network that is confined to an area such as a builing or house. This network is used to connect devices through the use of switches, which are devices that send data to specific devices. A LAN can be used to connect multiple devices to one internet connection like in a home network. Think about how your phone, computer, and game console can all connect to the internet at the same time. This is thanks to the switch and the router. The switch handles the traffic and the router connects the switch to the internet. Routers can also be used to connect multiple switches together in order to form a network of smaller networks. \r\n\r\nFor a list of the WLAN types, please visit [this](../wirelesstypes)\r\n\r\n### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)\r\n\r\nThis is not a gender based network. This is a network that connects smaller networks around a city. Think about a college campus. With every building having it's own LAN network, you can connect them all together to make a MAN. Sometimes the campus MAN is called a campus network. MAN's are often between 3 and 30 miles. Some companies and government buildings might use a MAN to communicate between different buildings located at a distance. \r\n\r\n### Wide Area Network (WAN)\r\n\r\nA WAN is a network that stretches over a large distance. Imagine a single school that uses a LAN network. It can be connected to the other schools in the region using a WAN network, either directly or through the internet. Since each school is far apart they will often just group the LAN networks of each school in a way that is comprehensive for the system administrator. The system administrator will often be in charge or maintaining the WAN all the way down to the individual LAN and individual devices. This connectivity is ideal for the larger networks separated by a large distance.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nSo what would you call the internet? \r\n- The internet is a WAN as it covers large distances and many networks.\r\n\r\nWhat is my companies network?\r\n- Most likily it uses a LAN of some sort. \r\n- Most companies have WLANs setup. Sometimes you may have a few buildings networked together in a MAN, but this is not a common occurance unless you have multiple buildings in a city on the same network pysically connected. Most of the time you will have a LAN network setup for the emplyees and a VPN for remote workers to connect to the LAN. \r\n\r\nWhat network does my smart watch use? \r\n- There is usually a PAN connection to your phone. \r\n- Many can also use the Wi-Fi to connect to the WLAN.\r\n- Some even have a direct acces to the WAN via a a cellular link, this allows use as a phone without being connected to or in range of your phone.\r\n\r\nWhat are some examples of a MAN?\r\n- A cable connection is considered a MAN, as it is spread over a city and connects many down taps together to a satellite feed.\r\n- WiMax, which is a sebset of IEEE 802.16, is a MAN since it connects using microwave at large distances.","src/content/blog/APlusTerms/Networking/NetworkTypes.md","94cc0ebd4ad46250",{html:556,metadata:557},"<h2 id=\"network-types\">Network Types</h2>\n<p>There are many ways to connect devices to one another.

It is a command line tool for (un)installing, updating, \r\nand configuring windows features in an image. DISM can be used to capture, split, and manage .wim files, which hold windows images. What's an image?\r\nImage files are a way of representing a disk, more on that later. \r\n\r\nDISM is a powerful utility that allows you to modify your copy of windows from the command line. This allows you to customize the operating \r\nsystem in ways that aren't available in the system itself. I have used it to install packages, fix the operating system, and remove unwanted features. \r\nThis is a great tool shrouded in mystery so let's take a deeper look and unwrap this windows gem. \r\n\r\nOne thing I always like to do is try the command out first. In linux I would run `man` to get the manual pages but in windows you can often run the \r\ncommand with no options or with `/?` to get information on the command itself. This allows us (in most cases) to see a list of options for the command.\r\nIt also provides a syntax for how to use the command and any required arguments. This is what I got when I ran `DISM` in the windows terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool\r\n    Version: 10.0.22621.1\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISM.exe [dism_options] {Imaging_command} [<Imaging_arguments>]\r\n    DISM.exe {/Image:<path_to_offline_image> | /Online} [dism_options] \r\n            {servicing_command} [<servicing_arguments>]\r\n\r\n    DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\n    DISM enumerates, installs, uninstalls, configures, and updates features\r\n    and packages in Windows images.

It then accepts a `Imaging_command` and a list of `Image_arguments`. \r\n\r\nWe know from the description above that the `Imaging_command` is sorted into three groups: `FFU COMMANDS`, `WIM COMMANDS`, and `GENERIC IMAGING COMMANDS`.\r\n\r\n> DISM.exe {/Image:<path_to_offline_image> | /Online} [dism_options] {servicing_command} [<servicing_arguments>] \r\n\r\n\r\nIn this structure we either choose an offline image or a use `/Online` to signify that we are working on the running copy of windows. ***Not all of the servicing commands work on online images, aka running machines.***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is a FFU?\r\nA **FFU** is a **Full Flash Update** and it is a image that allows you to deploy a physical disk's image to another drive. It includes windows, system partition information, and recovery information.\r\n\r\nWe know the FFU capture commands from the above output.\r\n\r\n    /Capture-Ffu            - Captures a physical disk image into a new FFU file.\r\n    /Apply-Ffu              - Applies an .ffu image.\r\n    /Split-Ffu              - Splits an existing .ffu file into multiple read-only\r\n                                split FFU files.\r\n    /Optimize-Ffu           - Optimizes a FFU file so that it can be applied to storage \r\n                                of a different size.\r\n\r\n### What is a WIM?\r\n\r\nA **WIM**, as previously stated, is a file that uses **Windows Imaging Format**. It is a **W**indows **IM**age, or multiple, in a single disk image. \r\nThis first came with windows in Vista and allowed for a better customization of the disk image before deployment. You can also boot and run a **WIM**. \r\nMost images are sector based like drives. WIM files on the other hand are file based. \r\n\r\nMany WIM files will contain multiple copies of windows. For instance, the Windows install disk actually contains all of the copies of the desktop version.\r\nWindows s, Home, Professional can all be on the same disk. That's why you can install either version from one disk. It has been like this since at least Windows Vista. \r\nI remeber the disks that came with laptops often had each version and you would have to choose based on you key if you reinstalled. --Perhaps that's just me showing my age.\r\n\r\nIn the Vista days there was a took called ImageX. It was used to customized the OS for OEM builds. This meant that manufacturers could add\r\ndrivers, or bloatware, straight on the installer. ImageX was replaced with DISM in later versions of Windows. \r\n\r\nWindows Vista and 7 used ImageX to create **WIM** files.\r\n\r\nWindows 8 and later can use **DISM** to create and modify **WIM** files.\r\n\r\n*I vaguely remember using Norton Ghost in IT to create disk images that would be deployed to the many computers over the network using GhostCast and PXE boot. The more modern approach is to use Windows server to set up a PXE server. This is done using WIM files of the windows installer.*\r\n\r\nAs with the **FFU** commands, we can see that our **WIM** commands are as follows:\r\n\r\n    WIM COMMANDS:\r\n\r\n    /Apply-CustomDataImage  - Dehydrates files contained in the custom data image.\r\n    /Capture-CustomImage    - Captures customizations into a delta WIM file on a \r\n                                WIMBoot system. Captured directories include all \r\n                                subfolders and data.\r\n    /Get-WIMBootEntry       - Displays WIMBoot configuration entries for the \r\n                                specified disk volume.\r\n    /Update-WIMBootEntry    - Updates WIMBoot configuration entry for the \r\n                                specified disk volume.\r\n    /List-Image             - Displays a list of the files and folders in a \r\n                                specified image.\r\n    /Delete-Image           - Deletes the specified volume image from a WIM file\r\n                                that has multiple volume images.\r\n    /Export-Image           - Exports a copy of the specified image to another\r\n                                file.\r\n    /Append-Image           - Adds another image to a WIM file.\r\n    /Capture-Image          - Captures an image of a drive into a new WIM file.\r\n                                Captured directories include all subfolders and \r\n                                data.\r\n    /Get-MountedWimInfo     - Displays information about mounted WIM images.\r\n    /Get-WimInfo            - Displays information about images in a WIM file.\r\n    /Commit-Wim             - Saves changes to a mounted WIM image.\r\n    /Unmount-Wim            - Unmounts a mounted WIM image.\r\n    /Mount-Wim              - Mounts an image from a WIM file.\r\n    /Remount-Wim            - Recovers an orphaned WIM mount directory.\r\n    /Cleanup-Wim            - Deletes resources associated with mounted WIM \r\n                                images that are corrupted.\r\n\r\n### Generic imaging commands?\r\n\r\nThey provide a set of options for working with images despite their type.\r\n\r\n    GENERIC IMAGING COMMANDS:\r\n\r\n    /Split-Image            - Splits an existing .wim file into multiple \r\n                                read-only split WIM (SWM) files.\r\n    /Apply-Image            - Applies an image.\r\n    /Get-MountedImageInfo   - Displays information about mounted WIM and VHD\r\n                                images.\r\n    /Get-ImageInfo          - Displays information about images in a WIM, a VHD\r\n                                or a FFU file.\r\n    /Commit-Image           - Saves changes to a mounted WIM or VHD image.\r\n    /Unmount-Image          - Unmounts a mounted WIM or VHD image.\r\n    /Mount-Image            - Mounts an image from a WIM or VHD file.\r\n    /Remount-Image          - Recovers an orphaned image mount directory.\r\n    /Cleanup-Mountpoints    - Deletes resources associated with corrupted\r\n                                mounted images.\r\n\r\n## Using DISM \"Online\"\r\n\r\nAs we previously stated, using DISM online is using it on the currently running version of windows. This is an incredibly useful tool for working on the current system without having to redeploy or reimage. \r\n\r\nAs with the `DISM /?` command we can also get manual pages from specific parts of the DISM command. For instance, `DISM /online /?` will produce the following:\r\n\r\n    Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool\r\n    Version: 10.0.22621.1\r\n\r\n    Image Version: 10.0.22621.963\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following commands may be used to service the image:\r\n\r\n    OS UNINSTALL SERVICING COMMANDS:\r\n\r\n    /Set-OSUninstallWindow  - Sets the OS Uninstall Window.\r\n    /Get-OSUninstallWindow  - Gets the OS Uninstall Window.\r\n    /Remove-OSUninstall     - Remove the OS Uninstall.\r\n    /Initiate-OSUninstall   - Initiates the OS Uninstall\r\n\r\n    APPX SERVICING COMMANDS:\r\n\r\n    /Get-NonRemovableAppPolicy - Lists the package families configured \r\n                                to be nonremovable by enterprise policy.\r\n    /Set-NonRemovableAppPolicy - Sets enterprise nonremovable policy for \r\n                                a given package family. \r\n    /Optimize-ProvisionedAppxPackages - Optimizes provisioned appx footprint by \r\n                                hard-linking identical files across appx packages.\r\n    /Set-ProvisionedAppxDataFile - Places custom data into the specified app \r\n                                package (.appx or .appxbundle).

You should use the /RevertPendingActions option only in a \r\n    system-recovery scenario to perform recovery operations on a Windows image \r\n    that did not boot. \r\n\r\n        Example: \r\n        DISM.exe /Image:C:\\test\\offline /Cleanup-Image /RevertPendingActions \r\n\r\n    /Cleanup-Image /spsuperseded [/hidesp] \r\n    Use /SPSuperseded to remove any backup files created during the installation \r\n    of a service pack. Use /HideSP to prevent the service pack from being listed \r\n    in the Installed Updates for the operating system. \r\n\r\n    WARNING! The service pack cannot be uninstalled after the /SPSuperseded \r\n    operation is completed. \r\n\r\n        Example: \r\n        DISM.exe /Image:C:\\test\\offline /Cleanup-Image /spsuperseded /hidesp \r\n\r\n    /Cleanup-Image {/CheckHealth | /ScanHealth | /RestoreHealth} \r\n    Use /CheckHealth to check whether the image has been flagged as corrupted \r\n    by a failed process and whether the corruption can be repaired. \r\n    Use /ScanHealth to scan the image for component store corruption. \r\n    Use /RestoreHealth to scan the image for component store corruption, and \r\n    then perform repair operations automatically. \r\n    Use /Source with /RestoreHealth to specify the location of known good \r\n    versions of files that can be used for the repair. For more information on \r\n    specifying a source location, see \r\n    https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243077. \r\n    Use /LimitAccess to prevent DISM from contacting WU/WSUS. \r\n\r\n        Example: \r\n        DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth\r\n\r\n        DISM.exe /Image:c:\\offline /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth \r\n        /Source:c:\\test\\mount \r\n\r\n    /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup [/ResetBase [/Defer]]\r\n    Use /StartComponentCleanup to clean up the superseded components and reduce\r\n    the size of the component store. Use /ResetBase to reset the base of \r\n    superseded components, which can further reduce the component store size.\r\n    Use /Defer with /ResetBase to defer long-running cleanup operations to the \r\n    next automatic maintenance. \r\n\r\n    WARNING!  The installed Windows Updates cannot be uninstalled after the \r\n    /StartComponentCleanup with /ResetBase operation is completed. \r\n\r\n        Example: \r\n        DISM.exe /Image:C:\\test\\offline /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup\r\n\r\n    /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore \r\n    Use /AnalyzeComponentStore to create a report of the WinSxS component store.\r\n    For more information about the WinSxS report and how to use the information\r\n    provided in the report, see\r\n    https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=293367. \r\n\r\n        Example: \r\n        DISM.exe /Image:C:\\test\\offline /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean? \r\n\r\nWell let's take a look at one of the most used arguments. `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image {/CheckHealth | /ScanHealth | /RestoreHealth} `\r\n\r\nIf you have had one of the many issues that exist with windows since 7 then there is a good chance you have seen this command. This uses the DISM tool on the \"Online\" windows image and the `Cleanup-Image` option. We then use the `/CheckHealth`, `/ScanHealth`, or `/RestoreHealth` servicing command to attempt to aqcuire information or attempt to fix the current windows image. ***This is a powerful tool.***\r\n\r\n\r\n #### CheckHealth\r\n \r\n > `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth`\r\n \r\n This is used to check the DISM version, image version, and weather or not the component store is currupted or repairable. This is one of the quickest ways of seeing if something is wrong with your current system. \r\n \r\n#### ScanHealth\r\n\r\n> `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth`\r\n\r\nThis is probably one of the most comman fix suggestions on the internet. Anything wonky with windows and people will suggest this as a quick fix. Why is this? Well, it works a small percentage of the time. \r\n\r\nWhat this does is scans the currently running windows image and checks for any issues that it can resolve. It can fix these issues by pulling the missing or broken dependencies from Microsoft. This option means not having to pull out installation media to attempt a fix of windows, or having to reinstall in many cases.\r\n\r\n#### RestoreHealth\r\n\r\n> `DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\r\n\r\nThis is the powerful tool we mentioned above. This allows us to restore the missing or currupt files from a trusted source. Using this command will pull the needed files from Microsoft to repair your running version of Windows. This isn't a cure-all but it works for most system corruption issues.","src/content/blog/APlusTerms/Windows/dism/whatIsDISM.md","8f57c6e402465d24",{html:746,metadata:747},"<h2 id=\"what-is-dism\">What is DISM</h2>\n<p><strong>DISM</strong> is a an acronym for <strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management</strong>. It is a command line tool for (un)installing, updating,\r\nand configuring windows features in an image. DISM can be used to capture, split, and manage .wim files, which hold windows images. What’s an image?\r\nImage files are a way of representing a disk, more on that later.</p>\n<p>DISM is a powerful utility that allows you to modify your copy of windows from the command line. This allows you to customize the operating\r\nsystem in ways that aren’t available in the system itself. I have used it to install packages, fix the operating system, and remove unwanted features.\r\nThis is a great tool shrouded in mystery so let’s take a deeper look and unwrap this windows gem.</p>\n<p>One thing I always like to do is try the command out first. In linux I would run <code>man</code> to get the manual pages but in windows you can often run the\r\ncommand with no options or with <code>/?</code> to get information on the command itself. This allows us (in most cases) to see a list of options for the command.\r\nIt also provides a syntax for how to use the command and any required arguments. This is what I got when I ran <code>DISM</code> in the windows terminal.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Version: 10.0.22621.1</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>DISM.exe [dism_options] {Imaging_command} [&#x3C;Imaging_arguments>]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>DISM.exe {/Image:&#x3C;path_to_offline_image> | /Online} [dism_options] </span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        {servicing_command} [&#x3C;servicing_arguments>]</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>DESCRIPTION:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>DISM enumerates, installs, uninstalls, configures, and updates features</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>and packages in Windows images.

It is a <strong>W</strong>indows <strong>IM</strong>age, or multiple, in a single disk image.\r\nThis first came with windows in Vista and allowed for a better customization of the disk image before deployment. You can also boot and run a <strong>WIM</strong>.\r\nMost images are sector based like drives. WIM files on the other hand are file based.</p>\n<p>Many WIM files will contain multiple copies of windows. For instance, the Windows install disk actually contains all of the copies of the desktop version.\r\nWindows s, Home, Professional can all be on the same disk. That’s why you can install either version from one disk. It has been like this since at least Windows Vista.\r\nI remeber the disks that came with laptops often had each version and you would have to choose based on you key if you reinstalled. —Perhaps that’s just me showing my age.</p>\n<p>In the Vista days there was a took called ImageX. It was used to customized the OS for OEM builds. This meant that manufacturers could add\r\ndrivers, or bloatware, straight on the installer. ImageX was replaced with DISM in later versions of Windows.</p>\n<p>Windows Vista and 7 used ImageX to create <strong>WIM</strong> files.</p>\n<p>Windows 8 and later can use <strong>DISM</strong> to create and modify <strong>WIM</strong> files.</p>\n<p><em>I vaguely remember using Norton Ghost in IT to create disk images that would be deployed to the many computers over the network using GhostCast and PXE boot.

This uses the DISM tool on the “Online” windows image and the <code>Cleanup-Image</code> option. We then use the <code>/CheckHealth</code>, <code>/ScanHealth</code>, or <code>/RestoreHealth</code> servicing command to attempt to aqcuire information or attempt to fix the current windows image. <em><strong>This is a powerful tool.</strong></em></p>\n<h4 id=\"checkhealth\">CheckHealth</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is used to check the DISM version, image version, and weather or not the component store is currupted or repairable. This is one of the quickest ways of seeing if something is wrong with your current system.</p>\n<h4 id=\"scanhealth\">ScanHealth</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is probably one of the most comman fix suggestions on the internet. Anything wonky with windows and people will suggest this as a quick fix. Why is this? Well, it works a small percentage of the time.</p>\n<p>What this does is scans the currently running windows image and checks for any issues that it can resolve. It can fix these issues by pulling the missing or broken dependencies from Microsoft. This option means not having to pull out installation media to attempt a fix of windows, or having to reinstall in many cases.</p>\n<h4 id=\"restorehealth\">RestoreHealth</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the powerful tool we mentioned above. This allows us to restore the missing or currupt files from a trusted source. Using this command will pull the needed files from Microsoft to repair your running version of Windows. This isn’t a cure-all but it works for most system corruption issues.</p>",{headings:748,localImagePaths:781,remoteImagePaths:782,frontmatter:783,imagePaths:784},[749,751,754,757,760,763,766,769,772,775,778],{depth:40,slug:750,text:739},"what-is-dism",{depth:50,slug:752,text:753},"dism-command-structure","DISM Command Structure",{depth:50,slug:755,text:756},"what-is-a-ffu","What is a FFU?",{depth:50,slug:758,text:759},"what-is-a-wim","What is a WIM?",{depth:50,slug:761,text:762},"generic-imaging-commands","Generic imaging commands?",{depth:40,slug:764,text:765},"using-dism-online","Using DISM “Online”",{depth:40,slug:767,text:768},"why-use-dism","Why Use DISM?",{depth:50,slug:770,text:771},"repairing-windows","Repairing Windows",{depth:422,slug:773,text:774},"checkhealth","CheckHealth",{depth:422,slug:776,text:777},"scanhealth","ScanHealth",{depth:422,slug:779,text:780},"restorehealth","RestoreHealth",[],[],{title:739,description:740,draft:30,category:741},[],"APlusTerms/Windows/dism/whatIsDISM.md","react/classvfunction",{id:786,data:788,body:792,filePath:793,digest:794,rendered:795,legacyId:812},{title:789,description:790,category:791},"React Components: Class vs Function","This is a comparison of using React component classes vs Function components","REACT","If you started using React a while ago then you probably learned how to make components using classes. The new trend seems to be to use functions. \r\n\r\nWhich is better and which is right?\r\n\r\nYou can use either but with the introduction of hooks functions have taken a hold.\r\n\r\n## Component Classes\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n        this.state = { data: props.data };\r\n    }\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                {this.state.data}\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is an example of a component class called MyComponent. It shows the skeleton of how the component class works. While there are other functions such as `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`, we are looking at the basics here.\r\n\r\nIf you are familiar with programming then you probably already know that this does something that a function can't. This class has a **constructor**. A **constructor** is a function that executes when the class is created. In the case of this component it is used to take in the **props** and set the state accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of having a constructor is that it allows us to pass in properties when our component is made. It can also be used to initialize anything else the component might need. \r\n\r\nThe `render` function is a special function that we define. It returns *JSX* to define the *DOM* of the component. \r\n\r\nOverall, the class component is simple and easy to throw together. The complication is when you have a complex app that has many components that need to share state information. This is when we run into the dreaded `prop drilling`.\r\n\r\n## Prop Drilling\r\n\r\nLet's say we have a component inside a component inside a component. That gives us a parent child situation that has depth. If we want to have access to the parent's information in the innermost child component then how do we access it? Well first we need to pass the values as props from parent to child. Then we do it again. This looks a little something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass Parent extends Component {\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n    }\r\n    render() {\r\n        <div>\r\n            <childCompA data = this.props.data />\r\n        </div>\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction childCompA(props) {\r\n    return(\r\n        <div>\r\n            <childCompB data = props.data />\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction childCompB(props) {\r\n    return(\r\n        <div>\r\n            <childCompB data = props.data />\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nFor simplicity I used functions for the child components. \r\n\r\nWhile the data in `childCompB` is successfully passed down from the parent, it is inconvenient to have to pass the value through each component. This requires us to design each component with that data in mind. This also means we have several points of possible failure. Forget to refactor a part of one component and all of a sudden your app is broken. \r\n\r\nSo what's the solution?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## Component Functions\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs is life, trends tend to take a hold of how we live. The modern trend, at least as of writing this, is to use function components instead of Class components. Why is that? Well, it is simpler for one. With the introduction of hooks, more on that later, we can write the same component with less code and less complexity. As we know KISS, Keep It Simple Stupid or Keep It Stupid Simple, is the best way to design most things. The lack of complexity makes it easy to follow and the shorter code means getting right to the point.\r\n\r\nWith function components we simply write our JSX we want rendered in the return value of the component. Once returned, assuming the JSX is valid, we can have our component rendered the same as if we had a render() function in a class. Since this is JavaScript we can add functions to our function if necessary and we can pass in props . We can then use the useState() hook to set and get state data. Let's take a look. \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nfunction Viewer() {\r\n  const [blogContent, setBlogContent] = useState('')\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <div id=\"side-panel\">\r\n        <ul>\r\n          {\r\n            blogList.map( blog => {\r\n              return (<li> <button type='button' id={blog + '-btn'} >{blog}</button></li>)\r\n            })\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div id=\"blog-content\">\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```","src/content/blog/react/classVfunction.md","8a73ca8d0b2e6661",{html:796,metadata:797},"<p>If you started using React a while ago then you probably learned how to make components using classes.

Subsystems for Linux GUI","WSL","# What is WSLg\r\n\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with WSL then might I suggest that you start with my previous post [here](../wsl)\r\n\r\nWSL has changed a lot over it's short life. When it first came out it only worked for **CLI**, or **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface, programs. Since then there have been advancements allowing graphical linux apps that use X11 or Wayland to run on windows. This is thanks to something called [WSLg](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg). *I remember when WSLg first came out you had to download it separate from WSL, now it is an included feature.*\r\n\r\nIf you have a WSL distro from before WSLg then you can update your distro. First thing is to switch to version 2 of WSL for the distro if you haven't already.\r\n> `wsl --set-version <distro> 2`\r\n\r\nNext you update the distro using `wsl --update <distro>`\r\n\r\n# Installing WSLg apps\r\n\r\nNow it's as simple as installing X11 or Wayland apps on your WSL distro. The people at microsoft have worked hard to make WSLg a built in part of WSL. \r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### x11-apps\r\nWe can install the x11 apps fron the terminal like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudp apt install x11-apps\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhats in the x11-apps package? Well, let's take a look.\r\n\r\n    dpkg -L x11-apps\r\n\r\ngives us the following\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n    /usr/bin/atobm\r\n    /usr/bin/bitmap\r\n    /usr/bin/bmtoa\r\n    /usr/bin/ico\r\n    /usr/bin/oclock\r\n    /usr/bin/rendercheck\r\n    /usr/bin/transset\r\n    /usr/bin/x11perf\r\n    /usr/bin/x11perfcomp\r\n    /usr/bin/xbiff\r\n    /usr/bin/xcalc\r\n    /usr/bin/xclipboard\r\n    /usr/bin/xclock\r\n    /usr/bin/xconsole\r\n    /usr/bin/xcursorgen\r\n    /usr/bin/xcutsel\r\n    /usr/bin/xditview\r\n    /usr/bin/xedit\r\n    /usr/bin/xeyes\r\n    /usr/bin/xgc\r\n    /usr/bin/xload\r\n    /usr/bin/xlogo\r\n    /usr/bin/xmag\r\n    /usr/bin/xman\r\n    /usr/bin/xmore\r\n    /usr/bin/xwd\r\n    /usr/bin/xwud\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Speculatory side note:\r\n>\r\n> *So we can run xcalc on windows. Why, you might ask. It's not about running an uglier calculator on windows. This represents a proof of concept that demonstrates linux applicaitons running in windows. This is something I have wanted since I learned linux in 2008. Yes you could run a VM, but that's extra overhead on your computer. Being able to run linux and now android apps in windows means a unified space for developers. We have seen how certain game console failed because they were challenging to develop for. This added feature means an evnironment that can be used to develop for other environments. We have seen a massive shift in developers moving to linux thanks to it's build in tools, ease of use for networking and many other features, a powerful command line, and it being open. If windows can become a decent development environment then maybe they'll win back the devs. VS Code was a good start.*\r\n\r\nLet's try something more useful than these basic utility apps shall we.\r\n\r\n### Firefox\r\n\r\nEveryone that's familiar with computers should be familiar with firefox. Mozilla, the company behind firefox, offers one of the best resources for web developers, the MDN. The Mozilla Developer Network is a free set of documentation for javascript, HTML, CSS, web API's and more. \r\n\r\nFirefox itself may have seen better days usage-wise, but it is still a very capable browser and is often times the default for many linux distos. \r\n\r\nMaybe you are tired of all of your browsers having 20-50 tabs open, or maybe you like a little extra privacy. Whatever the case we can install and run firefox through WSLg quickly and easily.\r\n\r\nOn Debian systems\r\n\r\n> `sudo apt install firefox-esr -y`\r\n\r\nSo it's installed on our Debian WSL, now what?\r\n\r\nSimple, just run it. You should get something like this.\r\n\r\n![firefox](/public/blogContent/wsl/firefox-esr-debian-wsl.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSure the windows theme is lost a bit with wslg, but it is a running version of a debian build of firefox on windows. That in itself, is impressive. \r\n\r\n*I remeber learning about VM's and thinking it was the coolest thing 15+ years ago. This would have blown my mind back then*\r\n\r\nSo why run a linux version of Wirefox on Windows? Testing. \r\nIt's good to be able to test your web apps on multiple platforms. \r\nI'm sure there are other reasons, such as security, but that's a different aricle right there. \r\n\r\n## Real uses\r\n\r\nTo be honest I haven't really felt the need to use WSLg, at least not for more than playing around. \r\nWhile it is amazing technology, and I'm happy to see it around, I can just VNC into a VM on my Linux server.\r\nI'm sure not everyone has a server running on their network so WSLg makes sense for the layman, right? \r\nSure, that's one way of looking at it. \r\nIf I'm on the go and only have my laptop, or am at a workstation somewhere else, then I have the ability to run Linux native GUI apps in Windows without spinning up a VM.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of preference whether you would run a WSLg app or just run Windows in a VM. \r\nIn my personal experience the latter is the better opeion for power efficiency, security, and speed.\r\nI even have an image of Windows 7 that I run on my server every once in a while that use to run baremetal on that server. \r\nThe boot time, load speeds, and overall telemetry efficiency is greatly improved from running in the VM.\r\nWhen it ran baremetal it could take up to 5 minutes to boot, would hand on tasks, and felt much older than it was.\r\nIn the VM however, it boots in 20 or so seconds and is a smooth operator.\r\nThis is using an image of the disk that had previously been the boot drive, and is stored on a slower HDD.\r\n\r\nOn Windows WSLg github [page](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg) they show the Linux versions of Visual Studio Code, Chrome, xClock, and xCalc. Is this useful? No, not really. All of these have Windows versions that will probably run better in Windows tham the WSLg versions.\r\n\r\nThe practicallity of WSLg is being able to run Linux GUIs on windows without having to\r\n- Set up a VM\r\n- VNC into an existing system\r\n- Run Windows in a VM in Linux and just use the native apps\r\n- Dual Boot\r\n- Install a Windows version of the same app\r\n\r\nOverall this is a big win for Windows users and Linux users alike as we are bringing Linux into the foreground on Windows.","src/content/blog/APlusTerms/Windows/wsl/WSLg.md","c910df762a1df1ba",{html:906,metadata:907},"<h1 id=\"what-is-wslg\">What is WSLg</h1>\n<p>If you are unfamiliar with WSL then might I suggest that you start with my previous post <a href=\"../wsl\">here</a></p>\n<p>WSL has changed a lot over it’s short life.

Why, you might ask. It’s not about running an uglier calculator on windows. This represents a proof of concept that demonstrates linux applicaitons running in windows. This is something I have wanted since I learned linux in 2008. Yes you could run a VM, but that’s extra overhead on your computer. Being able to run linux and now android apps in windows means a unified space for developers. We have seen how certain game console failed because they were challenging to develop for. This added feature means an evnironment that can be used to develop for other environments. We have seen a massive shift in developers moving to linux thanks to it’s build in tools, ease of use for networking and many other features, a powerful command line, and it being open. If windows can become a decent development environment then maybe they’ll win back the devs. VS Code was a good start.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let’s try something more useful than these basic utility apps shall we.</p>\n<h3 id=\"firefox\">Firefox</h3>\n<p>Everyone that’s familiar with computers should be familiar with firefox. Mozilla, the company behind firefox, offers one of the best resources for web developers, the MDN. The Mozilla Developer Network is a free set of documentation for javascript, HTML, CSS, web API’s and more.</p>\n<p>Firefox itself may have seen better days usage-wise, but it is still a very capable browser and is often times the default for many linux distos.</p>\n<p>Maybe you are tired of all of your browsers having 20-50 tabs open, or maybe you like a little extra privacy. Whatever the case we can install and run firefox through WSLg quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>On Debian systems</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>sudo apt install firefox-esr -y</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it’s installed on our Debian WSL, now what?</p>\n<p>Simple, just run it. You should get something like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/public/blogContent/wsl/firefox-esr-debian-wsl.png\" alt=\"firefox\"></p>\n<p>Sure the windows theme is lost a bit with wslg, but it is a running version of a debian build of firefox on windows. That in itself, is impressive.</p>\n<p><em>I remeber learning about VM’s and thinking it was the coolest thing 15+ years ago. This would have blown my mind back then</em></p>\n<p>So why run a linux version of Wirefox on Windows? Testing.\r\nIt’s good to be able to test your web apps on multiple platforms.\r\nI’m sure there are other reasons, such as security, but that’s a different aricle right there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"real-uses\">Real uses</h2>\n<p>To be honest I haven’t really felt the need to use WSLg, at least not for more than playing around.\r\nWhile it is amazing technology, and I’m happy to see it around, I can just VNC into a VM on my Linux server.\r\nI’m sure not everyone has a server running on their network so WSLg makes sense for the layman, right?\r\nSure, that’s one way of looking at it.\r\nIf I’m on the go and only have my laptop, or am at a workstation somewhere else, then I have the ability to run Linux native GUI apps in Windows without spinning up a VM.</p>\n<p>It is a matter of preference whether you would run a WSLg app or just run Windows in a VM.\r\nIn my personal experience the latter is the better opeion for power efficiency, security, and speed.\r\nI even have an image of Windows 7 that I run on my server every once in a while that use to run baremetal on that server.\r\nThe boot time, load speeds, and overall telemetry efficiency is greatly improved from running in the VM.\r\nWhen it ran baremetal it could take up to 5 minutes to boot, would hand on tasks, and felt much older than it was.\r\nIn the VM however, it boots in 20 or so seconds and is a smooth operator.\r\nThis is using an image of the disk that had previously been the boot drive, and is stored on a slower HDD.</p>\n<p>On Windows WSLg github <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/wslg\">page</a> they show the Linux versions of Visual Studio Code, Chrome, xClock, and xCalc. Is this useful? No, not really.

It is a way of letting you install a linux distribution inside of windows. Why would you want to do this? It's simple, Linux is a wonderful environment with a plethora of built-in tools. Having access to this environment and tools inside of windows means not having to worry about running a virtual machine. It means not having to dual-boot, or run a separate computer to have access to these tools. It also allows you to access the windows environment with these linux tools.\r\n\r\nHaving used Linux for many years means certain features and tools are second nature. WSL allows us to have the best of both worlds. An easy example is being able to run `grep` in windows. You could also run `vim` or other *nix style environments. Another is having the ability to deploy your code in a linux environment without having to send it to another machine. This can increase productivity for cross-platform development. \r\n\r\nYou can use it to run GIT, or a database easily with little setup. This means you can run a production server and the production on the same machine. \r\n\r\n## How does WSL work\r\n\r\nWe know there are differences in Linux and Windows on a fundamental level. From file/folder structure to the function of these systems. So how do we get these different systems to work together. Traditionally we used a virtual machine to emulate the hardware of another computer and run the different operating system. This is limited as the guest and host OS can't communicate effectively. As we know communication is the key to success. \r\n\r\nWith WSL we can have the guest operating system be installed on the host operating system without the need for a virtual machine platform. We eliminate the need for VirtualBox or Hyper-V in this case. While we don't need them for WSL they still provide important use when testing and deploying images.\r\n\r\nWSL allows the linux kernel to run on top of the windows kernel by using a kernel interface. This allows us to run a shell or a background service as if we were running linux natively on the hardware with a little more overhead.\r\n\r\nAccording to the wsl program:\r\n```text\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

There is a small selection of Linux distributions that are already built for you. \r\n\r\nSome of the most common are Ubuntu, Debian, Suse, and Kali.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for the easiest way to get started with WSL then you can't get easier than installing 2 apps from the MS Store.\r\n\r\n![Ubuntu from the MS Store](/public/blogContent/wsl/MSStoreWSLUbuntu.png)\r\n\r\nSo what do we get with this installation?\r\n\r\nWell, we get a working copy of Ubuntu for starters. \r\n\r\nTO BE CONTINUED...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using the terminal\r\n\r\nAccording to the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) it is a simple process.\r\n***Microsoft describes this as a 6 step process but if you are running a modern install of windows then you can probably just do steps 1, 3 and 6 and be fine. This would make this more like a 3 easy step program.***\r\n\r\n#### Step 1 Enable WSL\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 2 Make sure you are using a supported version of Windows\r\n\r\n- x64 systems need Version 1903, Build 18362 or later.\r\n- ARM64 systems need Version 2004, Build 19041 or later.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3 Enable Virtual Machine feature\r\n\r\n> I thought you said WSL didn't use a VM?\r\n\r\nWell, yes and no. WSL 1 didn't use VM's but WSL 2 uses Windows hypervisor feature to run the linux kernel seamlessly with Windows. \r\n\r\nTo enable Windows hypervisor feature we simply enter the following into the terminal with administrator privlidges.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 4 Download the Linux kernel\r\n\r\nDownload the latest kernel update from the [Microsoft Store](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi) and run the update package.\r\n\r\n#### Step 5 Set WSL 2 as default\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nwsl --set-default-version 2\r\n```\r\nThis will set the default version of wsl to 2.\r\n\r\n#### Step 6 Install Linux Distro from MS Store\r\n\r\n![MS Store](/public/blogContent/wsl/MSStoreWSL.png)\r\n\r\nOpen the MS Store and install a Linux distro.\r\n\r\n## Once it's running\r\n\r\nWe finally return to the list of available options for the `wsl` command. Let's start with the basics. \r\n\r\n##### Lists\r\n\r\nHere's how we list the wsl distros installed on the machine `wsl --list`. We have the following opetions we can add to this:\r\n\r\n        --all\r\n            List all distributions, including distributions that are\r\n            currently being installed or uninstalled.\r\n\r\n        --running\r\n            List only distributions that are currently running.\r\n\r\n        --quiet, -q\r\n            Only show distribution names.\r\n\r\n        --verbose, -v\r\n            Show detailed information about all distributions.\r\n\r\n        --online, -o\r\n            Displays a list of available distributions for install with 'wsl.exe --install'.\r\n\r\nLet's make a not of a couple of those. `--running` allows us to see the running distros and `--online` allows us to see the available distributions we can install using wsl and an internet connection. Wsl will download the distro from the microsoft store.\r\n##### Terminate\r\nWhile running a WSL distro isn't as demanding on your system as a full VM, it is still a resource drain and there are cases when you might want to stop that. To terminate a distribution you can use `wsl --terminate <wsl name>`. So for example, let's say you wanted to terminate a distro named kali-linux. You would enter \r\n```powershell\r\nwsl --terminate kali-linux\r\n```\r\n##### Shutdown\r\n\r\nIf you want to shutdown all running distributions then you can use `wsl --shutdown`. This will shutdown all of the running distributions.\r\n\r\n##### Install\r\n\r\nUsing `wsl --install <distro>` we can install a distro straight from wsl.exe. Which distros do they have? Well, look back at our `--list` section. If we use `wsl --list --online` we will get a list of available distros. \r\n\r\n    The following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.\r\n    Install using 'wsl.exe --install <Distro>'.\r\n\r\n    NAME               FRIENDLY NAME\r\n    Ubuntu             Ubuntu\r\n    Debian             Debian GNU/Linux\r\n    kali-linux         Kali Linux Rolling\r\n    SLES-12            SUSE Linux Enterprise Server v12\r\n    SLES-15            SUSE Linux Enterprise Server v15\r\n    Ubuntu-18.04       Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\r\n    Ubuntu-20.04       Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\r\n    OracleLinux_8_5    Oracle Linux 8.5\r\n    OracleLinux_7_9    Oracle Linux 7.9\r\n\r\nThis list changes as new versions of distributions are released and updated. This is, at least for me, the easiest way of installing a wsl distro. Simply enable wsl, and install a distro from the app. Microsoft takes care of the rest.\r\n\r\n##### Running\r\n\r\nSo we can run the default distribution by using the `wsl` command with no arguments. This is fine but what if you want to run the one you installed after that? You can choose your distribution by using the `--distribution` or `-d` option. \r\n\r\nLet's say we want to run Debian from our installed distros. We would use \r\n`wsl -d Debian`.","src/content/blog/APlusTerms/Windows/wsl/wsl.md","9776a1dae7294ea3",{html:970,metadata:971},"<p>Table Of Contents</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#what-is-wsl\">What is WSL</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-does-wsl-work\">How Does it work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#getting-started\">Getting Started</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#using-the-microsoft-store\">Using Store</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#using-the-terminal\">Using Terminal</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#once-its-running\">Using WSL</a></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-wsl\">What is WSL</h2>\n<p>As the name of the article suggests, <strong>WSL</strong> stands for <strong>Windows Subsyem for Linux</strong>. It is a way of letting you install a linux distribution inside of windows. Why would you want to do this? It’s simple, Linux is a wonderful environment with a plethora of built-in tools. Having access to this environment and tools inside of windows means not having to worry about running a virtual machine. It means not having to dual-boot, or run a separate computer to have access to these tools. It also allows you to access the windows environment with these linux tools.</p>\n<p>Having used Linux for many years means certain features and tools are second nature. WSL allows us to have the best of both worlds. An easy example is being able to run <code>grep</code> in windows. You could also run <code>vim</code> or other *nix style environments. Another is having the ability to deploy your code in a linux environment without having to send it to another machine. This can increase productivity for cross-platform development.</p>\n<p>You can use it to run GIT, or a database easily with little setup. This means you can run a production server and the production on the same machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-wsl-work\">How does WSL work</h2>\n<p>We know there are differences in Linux and Windows on a fundamental level. From file/folder structure to the function of these systems. So how do we get these different systems to work together. Traditionally we used a virtual machine to emulate the hardware of another computer and run the different operating system. This is limited as the guest and host OS can’t communicate effectively. As we know communication is the key to success.</p>\n<p>With WSL we can have the guest operating system be installed on the host operating system without the need for a virtual machine platform. We eliminate the need for VirtualBox or Hyper-V in this case. While we don’t need them for WSL they still provide important use when testing and deploying images.</p>\n<p>WSL allows the linux kernel to run on top of the windows kernel by using a kernel interface. This allows us to run a shell or a background service as if we were running linux natively on the hardware with a little more overhead.</p>\n<p>According to the wsl program:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"text\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

Let’s start with the basics.</p>\n<h5 id=\"lists\">Lists</h5>\n<p>Here’s how we list the wsl distros installed on the machine <code>wsl --list</code>. We have the following opetions we can add to this:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>    --all</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        List all distributions, including distributions that are</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        currently being installed or uninstalled.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --running</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        List only distributions that are currently running.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --quiet, -q</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        Only show distribution names.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --verbose, -v</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        Show detailed information about all distributions.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>    --online, -o</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        Displays a list of available distributions for install with 'wsl.exe --install'.</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Let’s make a not of a couple of those. <code>--running</code> allows us to see the running distros and <code>--online</code> allows us to see the available distributions we can install using wsl and an internet connection. Wsl will download the distro from the microsoft store.</p>\n<h5 id=\"terminate\">Terminate</h5>\n<p>While running a WSL distro isn’t as demanding on your system as a full VM, it is still a resource drain and there are cases when you might want to stop that. To terminate a distribution you can use <code>wsl --terminate &#x3C;wsl name></code>. So for example, let’s say you wanted to terminate a distro named kali-linux. You would enter</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"powershell\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">wsl </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">--</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">terminate kali</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">-</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">linux</span></span></code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"shutdown\">Shutdown</h5>\n<p>If you want to shutdown all running distributions then you can use <code>wsl --shutdown</code>. This will shutdown all of the running distributions.</p>\n<h5 id=\"install\">Install</h5>\n<p>Using <code>wsl --install &#x3C;distro></code> we can install a distro straight from wsl.exe. Which distros do they have? Well, look back at our <code>--list</code> section. If we use <code>wsl --list --online</code> we will get a list of available distros.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>The following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Install using 'wsl.exe --install &#x3C;Distro>'.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>NAME               FRIENDLY NAME</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Ubuntu             Ubuntu</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Debian             Debian GNU/Linux</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>kali-linux         Kali Linux Rolling</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>SLES-12            SUSE Linux Enterprise Server v12</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>SLES-15            SUSE Linux Enterprise Server v15</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Ubuntu-18.04       Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>Ubuntu-20.04       Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>OracleLinux_8_5    Oracle Linux 8.5</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>OracleLinux_7_9    Oracle Linux 7.9</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>This list changes as new versions of distributions are released and updated. This is, at least for me, the easiest way of installing a wsl distro. Simply enable wsl, and install a distro from the app. Microsoft takes care of the rest.</p>\n<h5 id=\"running\">Running</h5>\n<p>So we can run the default distribution by using the <code>wsl</code> command with no arguments.
