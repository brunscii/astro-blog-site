This is the standard that is used for Wi-Fi devices and how they connect to one another. \r\n\r\nThe following chart shows the different Wi-Fi iterations, link rate, and their radio frequencies:\r\n\r\n| Generation / Version |\tIEEE Standard\t| Adopted |\tMaximum link rate (Mbit/s)\t| Radio frequency (GHz) | Range (feet) Indoor - Outdoor|\r\n| ---| ---      | ---  | ---              | ---     | --- |\r\n| 0\t | 802.11\t  | 1997 | 1 to 2           |\t2.4     |  66 - 330 |\r\n| 1\t | 802.11b\t| 1999 | 1 to 11          |\t2.4     | 115 - 460 |\r\n| 2\t | 802.11a\t| 1999 | 6 to 54          |\t5       | 115 - 390 |\r\n| 3\t | 802.11g\t| 2003 | 6 to 54          |\t2.4     | 125 - 460 |\r\n| 4\t | 802.11n\t| 2008 | 72 to 600\t      | 2.4/5   | 230 - 820 |\r\n| 5\t | 802.11ac |\t2014 | 433 to 6933\t    | 5[5]    | 150 - 315 |\r\n| 6\t | 802.11ax | 2019 | 574 to 9608[3]   | 2.4/5   |  98 - 390 |\r\n| 6E | 802.11ax |\t2020 | 574 to 9608[3]\t  | 6[4]    |  98 - 390 |\r\n| 7  | 802.11be\t| TBD  | 1376 to 46120\t  | 2.4/5/6 |  98 - 390 | \r\n\r\nMost Wireless devices made now have wi-fi 5 or 6, that is AC or AX. Most AC routers can also support older standards like n and g. This is similar to how the g routers supported b eventhough most devices didnt use it by that time. \r\n\r\n";
