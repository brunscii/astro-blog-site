Over the last decade I have worked in retail, from stocker to management, and have met people from just about every walk of life. From business owners to former IT workers, people from different backgrounds flock to retail positions. The real question is why, what are the benefits, downfalls, and is it for you?</p>\n<p>I just want to start by saying that retail workers are an essential part of our economy. Without people to stock shelves, run registers, clean, and everything in between, there would be no commerce. That being said the retail worker is considered one of the lowest forms of employee. Why is this? Is it the barrier to entry for these positions? Is it the abundance of people that will work the position? Is it the lack of skill required for the position? Perhaps it is a mix of these things that keeps the retail worker in the shadows.</p>\n<p>The point of this post is to explain the pros, cons, and some examples of retail work. This isn’t designed to sway your opinion for or against retail postitions, but instead to share some experiences. The astute of you will probably be able to determine my views on the subject, but that is niether here nor there. This is just a way of sharing some of my personal experience from over 10 years of retail work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"barrier-to-entry\">Barrier to entry</h3>\n<p>With the low barrier to entry anyone can apply and get a job in the field. There is literally a job for anyone. Can’t run a register, you can probably push a broom around. Can’t push a broom, you can probably check receipts or spot people with equipment. Can’t deal with people, there’s always the accounting/cash side of things. In my tenure I have worked with many disabled people that were able to work and provide value to the overall store. You can think of working at a big retailer like community college. The barrier to entry is low enough that just about anyone can get in, while there are still some people that get rejected.</p>\n<p>Who gets rejected? The unfair bit of retail is the drug testing. People fail them all of the time. It is ultimately unfair to judge someone based on how they spend their free time. If someone were to apply for a position at a grocery store after their trip to Colorado then they could easily fail a drug test for something that is legal in another state. Controversial take, many people can trick drug tests so you only weed out the honest drug users. That being said you don’t stop the crafty ones that are willing to lie and cheat to get a job.</p>\n<p>What about background checks? Those also pose a risk for potential employees. Most companies require a background check for felonies and sometimes even credit scores. This is supposed to weed out the dangerous people or those that might steal. This is just another way or biasing the system. There are plenty of nonviolent, non-theft related felonies, and as always this archaic system doesn’t leave room for interpretation. Some places even require a credit check to show if someone is in debt. The though behind that is that those in debt are more willing to steal. Realistically speaking, if someone is going to steal, then they probably wouldn’t be in debt in the first place. This is more of a way of sifting out the “undesirables” than a real measure of security. With most things, this should be left up to manager’s discretion; however, most retail chains don’t even trust their management teams.</p>\n<h3 id=\"abundance-of-options\">Abundance of options</h3>\n<p>As a former hiring manager, I have first hand experience pulling from the application pool. Believe me when I say there was no real shortage of applicants. There may have been times in which we had more or less depending on the season but there was usually someone to call in for an interview. Qualification on the other hand was the problem. If I want to hire a supervisor and no one internal is qualified, then it might be a struggle to find an external hire to fill the position. That being said, the labor shortage is a more of a political buzzword than a reality.</p>\n<p>Yes there may have been a shallower applicant pool during the pandemic, but generally speaking applicants are abundant when the pay and position is reasonable. Talk to HR and hiring manager and you’ll find out that when the economy got tighter so did the hiring pool. I’ve seen job postings for software developers where the posting would collect 900 applications in 24 hours. How can there be a shortage of applicants for retail when there is such an abundance of developers? Pay and benefits. No one wants to work themselves to death for minimum wage. This isn’t a labor shortage, this is a pay shortage. Working 40 hours a week for $7.25 an hour is less than $1200 a month. That wont even cover rent for most people. If there is a low number of applicants it is up to the company to adjust starting pay and benefits to make the position more enticing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"benefits\">Benefits</h3>\n<p>There are a few benefits to working in retail. There is the low barrier to entry and the plethora of jobs. The fact that you don’t need to have a formal education or a certain amount of experience means that just about anyone cane get a job. See the earlier section for the pitfalls. The abundance of jobs means that you can grab a job and work while getting into the field of your choice. Sometimes, at higher levels, the money is actually decent. For example, a Walmart store manager can start at $125,000 with the potential of a bonus that is 125% of that. I have personally seen store managers make $90,000 bonuses. That being said, you can also expect to spend the majority of your time and energy on the store.</p>\n<p>One of the other main benefits is that you can learn on the job. Learning how to merchandise, increase sales, and properly service customers are skills that will carry over to any other field. Some places even have academies to send their management teams. While these skills might not be the best on a resume, they can carry over from company to company. Inventory control is essential to managing inventory flow, merchandising teaches visual styling, and customer service is a universal skill when in a front facing environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-escape-the-world-of-retail\">Trying to escape the world of retail</h2>\n<p>There exists a problem in which people start a retail job and then give up on their dreams. If anything it is a common joke among retail workers. People grab a job and then settle into that job. The problem is that the either exert all of their energy in that job or get too comfortable and stop looking for something better.</p>\n<p>So what is the solution? Keep working on you skills in the field that you want to learn. Want to be a web developer? Keep making web sites. Want to work in IT? Study for the A+ or keep applying to entry level roles.</p>\n<p>have personally seen many people leave retail for a new career. I worked with someone that unloaded trucks and stocked. He went to school at the same time and later got a job as a diesel mechanic. This was a rare case in retail. I’m not saying that people can’t escape the void of retail, but it isn’t that common. Most of the people you see “going to school” live in a fantasy land where they take 1-2 just to say that they are in school. One girl that worked under me was always doing homework on her breaks, fast forward to 7-8 years later and she is still “in school.” For some it is a status symbol, for some it makes them feel more important, and for some it makes them have hope that they will have a better job one day. The real reason they never leave the world of retail is that they usually have job security and are scared of change.</p>\n<p>The trick is persistence and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. There is an old saying about growth only happens outside of your comfort zone. When we push ourselves to do something that makes us feel uncomfortable then we begin to understand our selves. When I first became a manager I wasn’t sure of how to tell people what to do and was afraid of what people thought of me. The truth is that you always want people to like you, you just learn to be comfortable with telling people they are wrong. When you force yourself to confront an individual and solve a problem then you learn to better communicate your needs as well as that of the company. This mindset is something that is learned through experience. Some of the meanest managers I knew started out as push overs. Pushing yourself to grow in new ways is how you escape the retail hell by learning how to assimilate into a world outside of selling and stocking.</p>\n<h3 id=\"existential-dread\">Existential Dread</h3>\n<p>If you look, you will find an abundance of escapism in the realm of retail workers. There is no shortage of existential dread for those in a dead end job. The question then becomes, does the job create the dread or are people that are lost and broken drawn to retail through a lack of ambition? The reality is a mix of both. Those that are lost or broken need to survive, the basis for which in our society is through monetary gains. The simplest for of which is through trading our time and energy for the ability to feed and shelter ourselves. The life that is then created is one of need.</p>\n<p>According to Maslow, we have a hierarchy of needs. Starting with our physiological needs, we have a duty to ourselves to fulfill those needs. Once we have adequately met the need for food, water, air, shelter, and anything else physical then we can move up the hierarchy of needs. The problem is that shelter is becoming increasingly difficult to procure on the retail salary. If one is in a constant state or worry about their physical needs, such as being able to eat or having a place to stay, then they cannot grow as a person or fulfill their other needs.</p>\n<p>The next level of need we posses is that of safety. Once again, on a retail salary it can be difficult to obtain safety both through living arrangements and through that of our health care. America is especially known for having a horrendously expensive medical system. The truth is many have to face the choice of having a doctor’s appointment or eating, and usually the baser need prevails. The mandated health insurance in America is a joke that only the rich laugh at. It provides a new burden to the working class in the form of hundreds of dollars a month that they do not have to spare while providing little to no benefit in terms of health care. A doctor’s visit is still expensive enough to bankrupt most workers for a month and often health is neglected as the $300 visit may mean not being able to make ends meet. It’s crazy how that little amount of money can make such a huge difference, and yet we are expected to pay that much to a company that only provides a security theater to our health.</p>\n<p>The next need is love and belonging. Having all of the previous needs met means that we can focus our attentions on love and affection towards family and friends. This is often in a higher regard than the other needs, ie. the person that is more worried about getting lucky than their own safety and well-being. Most retail centers will have their fair share of secret lovers and intimate encounters. The same can be said of any social environment really. College, parties, and work are places where people are grouped together, either willingly or not, and are placed where connections are formed. This can be though shared suffering in the form of finals or working too many hours. It can also be through celebrations such as the end of finals, vacation, promotion, or whatever a party might be about. This creates an environment for us to fulfill our social needs and focus on something other than supporting ourselves.</p>\n<p>While some might argue that social interaction is over rated, it is an important part of existence, especially in retail. The next part of the hierarchy is esteem, something that often eludes those in retail. The esteem category includes our status in society, respect from others, recognition, and freedom. If you work a job that barely affords you a sense of physical security then chances are you don’t feel free but are rather a wage slave. Working becomes a necessity and being able to change jobs, location, or schedules is not a luxury of this field.</p>\n<p>In my tenure working retail I have amassed many horror stories of rude, angry, and degrading customers. People that make themselves feel better through making others miserable are abundant. They live for being rude and degrading to retail workers. Not a day goes by in which a retail worker doesn’t have to deal with a rude customer and depending on their place of employment it can often be many rude customers a day. People treat you as if you are an imbecile for working to survive. They feel like retail is only for people that are inferior and that they should let those workers know just how pathetic they are. Respect is not only not given, but it is taken away from workers from the customers as well as the companies they serve. The low wages, the lying managers, and the pizza party instead of an actual incentives are just a few examples of how we are insulted by the company. For those retail workers that make it this far up the hierarchy, the esteem category is often one that will go unfulfilled.</p>\n<p>Self-actualization is the capstone of the hierarchical pyramid. The desire to become a better person is often something with unfulfilled needs cannot achieve. This is the killer part of the existential dread. The fact is that you will not feel fulfilled unless you come to terms with your life and accept it as is. having your needs met is a great way to do this but working retail makes that in and of itself a challenge. It takes great mental prowess to overcome the other needs and feel like you are enough. Enough for your own life, enough for others to love, enough for anything. The sad truth is that most will never realize self actualization and in term spend their reality in a sense of unmotivated insufficiency. Others may spend their lives in a sense of delirium, choosing to ignore the fact that they are living paycheck to paycheck and ignoring other needs completely in the pursuit of happiness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"anecdotal-evidence\">Anecdotal Evidence</h2>\n<p>This is the part in which I share some of my personal experiences within my retail career. I share interactions, communications, and how they made me feel. This is not meant to discourage anyone from working retail but instead to shine a light on how they worker’s are treated. I will share both positive and negative interactions with customers, management, and associates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fights-overnight\">Fights Overnight</h3>\n<p>The first week overnight in one of the Wilmington stores I saw 3 homeless fights, a drug overdose, and an employee fight nearly happen. Having worked overnight before in previous stores I wasn’t worried until I noticed how “ghetto” the store I was working in was. The first day there I parked next to a car with a person hanging out the driver’s door. I addumed they were passed out asleep. When I went on lunch I noticed an ambulance taking them away. I felt responsible for a while until I realized that I didn’t even consider they had OD’d. They had seemed unconscious but I have seen countless people sleep on the streets like that downtown. To me, they seemed asleep, passed out as if one had cunsumed too much the night before. I saw no syringe, or signs of drugs from what I saw but I felt bad none the less.</p>\n<p>The first night there I saw a couple of homeless people fighting over beer thay they were drinking by the bathrooms. I had heard the manager that was showing me around start yelling while I was in the back and quickly ran to where he was. It turns out that there was two men arguing about something silly and throwing cans of beer as well as fists. As I arrived the other manager had broken them up long enough for the one homeless man to say “he started it!” I said something along the lines of “I don’t care who started it! You can’t drink in the store, and you’re making a mess and you have to leave.” The one said “I bought this beer and I have a reciept.” In hindsight he probably just found a receipt int he parking lot and grabbed the same beer. I said something like “I don’t care, you’ve already destroyed half of it, just get out of here.”</p>\n<p>I proceeded to see homeless fights, shoplifters, and recieved the occaisional death threat until something crazy happened. A little something called covid 19. They told me that they were going to shut down parts of the store and I thought they were crazy. They told me to wear a mask and contiue working like normal. Do the same amount of work while also doing temperature checks and shutting down the store. The upside to closing is that there were no homeless fights, no strippers coming in for the workers to get distracted by, and no one to mess up the store while we recovered from the mess we were left from the day crew.</p>\n<h3 id=\"truck-loads-of-fun\">Truck Loads of Fun</h3>\n<p>When I was at UNCW I worked unloading trucks at Walmart. I have personally seen quite a few people get hurt while unloading trucks. I saw one person get hit in the head with a cast iron candle that someeone thought would be goot to put at the top of a rather unstable and large stack of boxes. As soon as he touched the one the candle came down from nearly 10 feet in the air and smacked him right in the side of the head. He immediately clutched his head and ran writhed in pain. Luckily it hit someone with a rather thick skull and he was alright but the way these trucks are loaded is not only dangerous, but idiotic at times.</p>\n<p>One fun time I saw a pallet of water sitting on top of a pallet of TV’s. I’ve seen crushed produce, whole pallets of dairy turned over and countless crushed boxes from carelessness in the wharehouse or through transit. Th half wrapped pallets and unsecured loads make tricky unloads. The already turned over egg and dairy pallets make for a slippery mess while also burning extra time cleaning up the mess, unloading, and through claiming out the damages.</p>\n<p>There was one point, during the summer, where the trucks were so hot that even the candles would melt. I stuck my head in a melted candle once. If you have never experienced this kind of heat, then it is quite exhousting to work in, especially while constantly lifting upwards of 50 lbs.</p>\n<p>At one point the unloader’s job was to unload the GM truck, sort breakpacks ( mixed up boxes of freight ), unload and sort the grocery truck, and to pull everything out to the sales floor. There was a time in which I was the only person that showed up to work on 2nd shift IMS (The unload crew). As the only person it is impossible to unload 2000 pieces by yourself and do everything else in a day. With a team of sales associates I unloaded the truck, pulled and sorted the grocery truck by aisle, and sorted the breakpacks. All with time to spare. This was a feat that my older self probably couldn’t, or at least wouldn’t do. I then proceeded to deop a pallet on my foot while cleaning up and smash the end of my toe. With a bloody foot, I hobbled into the AD office and asked for a band aid. The Manager on duty looked at me and said “ew gross. Don’t get blood everywhere.” There was no “great job getting everything sorted” and no “Oh meh god, are you alright?!?!” Instead I was just told I could leave early. Basically I had woked myself to death just to loose out on money from leaving early. What a deal. I wasn’t told to fill out an incident report and I was just told to not bleed everywhere. He had even asked me if I could pull everything out to the floor with a bloody foot. This was the thanks for overachievement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thieving-coworkers\">Thieving Coworkers</h3>\n<p>I worked with a guy that would buy a drink at the register in electronics and say he already got the rest of the snacks he had, just to steal them and eat what wasn’t his.</p>\n<p>I worked with a guy that would drink chocolate milk inside the dairy cooler and then place the empty cartons in the claims area. When management found out she had told him just don’t do it anymore. He told her his family was hungry and that they weren’t eating properly. This was a lie since he lived with his girlfriend’s parents, who made sure their daughter and her baby were fed. This guy was also quite large for someone that would have been starving, and also brought a lunch every day. He then proceeded to steal steaks, yogurt, and drinks just for the sake of doing so. This went on until he finally quit to move to another state.</p>\n<p>One set of cousines managed to steal thousands in electronics by sneaking it through the edge of the truck. They would go around and scoop up the dropped iPhones and iPads. They would talk about needing a new laptop and joke while dropping it through the hole. This went on for a while with the store knowing. All high ticket items are checked for on the trucks now to prevent this from happeneing.</p>\n<p>Wherever there is commerce there is sure to be bad actors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lack-of-work-ethics\">Lack of work ethics</h3>\n<p>In any position you will have people that do more and less than the average worker. This is just a fact of life. Not everyone performs at the same rate, yet they can get paid at the same rate. One of the most infuriating things is working hard to get something done just to be rewarded with more work than your co-workers. When you spend an entire day sweating just to see someone that makes more than you walk around and chat all day, it’s beyond annoying. Every store will have your typical talker’s that wonder around and BS all day. It’s just a fact of retail.</p>\n<p>I once worked in a store that had a manager that would sleep while working overnight. He was an obese man that would exaggerate any achievement he had overnight while always talking down any other manager. He would act as if he could run any part of the store better than anyone else. My first night overnight, covering his vacation, I was told I did better than he ever did. When they told me I had to go overnight I was in a panic. I was affraid of failing. What I did was ask the people I knew did overnight well how they did it. I would also talk to all of the workers and see what they needed to get the job done. I prioritized what I knew the store manager looked for, since I toured with him many mornings, and I made sure the store was clean when I was walked off. Little did I know I would be walked off by the meanest and most senor ASM we had. Even though we were the same position her word was gold to the store manager.</p>\n<p>She walked up and down most of the aisles in grocery, searching for any mistakes. Chekced the backroom looking for unworked freight and any messes. She couldn’t find a thing. For the first time she actually gave me a compliment and said good job. When she told me that I did better than she ever saw the other guy do I was escstatic. But at the same time, the other manager that sucked and talked himself up made more than me. I had been screwed on my yearly raise by lying managers that were like a bunch of snakes, slowly strangling the life out of me. Now don’t get me wrong, I got along with most of the team. That’s why it hurt more when they stabbed me in the back by going out of their way to make me look bad while they themselves were horrible at their jobs. When the store manager doesn’t leave the office and instead listens to a couple of snakes instead of the associates, you tend to get screwed.</p>\n<p>After proving my worth at that store I would often get punished with special assignments. As well as having to manage the backroom, grocery and consumables, I would also have to set up the store map and locations, plan and execute black fiday “event” day, and also close most of the time by myself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rude-customers\">Rude customers</h3>\n<p>I worked in the garden center one summer and had an angry old man tell me that the plant’s were dry. I said “ok, we have someone that is watering them now.” For some unknown reason the man said “what are you gonna do, piss on them?” My reaction was to say “if that’s what you want me to do.” To this day I have no idea what that old prick wanted. Perhaps all he wanted was to argue with a low paid worker, maybe he wanted to feel important with his enlightened conclusion of the plant being dry, or most likely he wanted to get plants at a discount when they were absolutely fine. This is not out of the ordinary for a retail worker.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite things that customers do is threaten to go to the competition or stop shopping at XYZ big box store because of some minor inconveinience. This is hilarious to me since my paycheck will stay the same regardless. Most retail associates don’t make commision, they don’t get sales based incentives, and they are usually too overworked and underpaid to care.</p>\n<p>Working at Lowes’ lumber department you might get someone that wants a piece of plywood cut into precise dimensions a dozen different ways. When you inform them of the store policy of 2 cuts per board you get one of two reactions; understanding, or them trying to reason with you either through inferior logic or angry rants. These latter people will often threaten to go to Home Depot. Curiously enough, this is the same thing people will say if you don’t carry whatever obscure piece of wood that they want. They thruth is that this is a meaningless threat to someone that isn’t paid enough to afford their basic necessities, let alone pay any mind to these silly gestures.</p>\n<p>I had an elderly man try to buy a gun one time. He had trouble entering his information in the computer to fill out the proper 4473 form. I told him repeatedly that I couldn’t fill the form out for him without a 3rd party witness, and since I was the only manager at the time I couldn’t have another sign off on me inputing his answers for him. This was a perk of being short staffed. I needed my sporting goods associate to verify the form and for myself to sign off on the transaction, thus I could not be involved in the filling out of the form. I spent 45 minutes explaining how the computer worked and showing him how to type in his answers. I helped him get back up to where he was but in his frustrations he continued to berate me and tell me that I “must not want to make the sale” and that “the other store’s would have filled it out.” After I explained the law again, he told me to “take that gun, shove it up your ass, and pull the triger.” I finally broke and told him I wouldn’t do the sale. I told him I was refusing him due to his attitude and the fact that he clearly was unstable. I later found this man in electronics yelling at one of my workers and asking for their name. I intervened and told hime “she doesn’t have to give you her last name.” He asked for my badge number, which is hilarious since we aren’t cops, and I told him to leave. He asked for my full name and where I lived, to which I gave it to him. Telling him if he wanted to drive the 70 miles to see me he could. Literally 2 days later the man came in the store and apologized to me for being an asshole. This was a coutesy that most won’t extend.</p>\n<p>Even though I try to approach everyone with respect, there are always customer that will degrade you to make themselves feel better.</p>\n<p>One man and his wife had asked if we had samples of trex they could take home. I informed them that the samples where in a box and we weren’t allowed to give them away, espescially since we wouldn’t be able to show anyone else that color without ordering an entire new box and waiting on it to come in. This answer wasn’t good enough for this smug old yankee. He quickly said “oh what is Lowes hurting for money? Should I just reach in my pocket and give them something? You guys look tired and like you don’t even want to be here.” This part was true as I had been working for 7 hours with out as much as a bathroom break at that point.</p>\n<p>He then said “you look unmotivated. What, they don’t pay you enough to be motivated?” Bear in mind that this is just because I wouldn’t let him take part of a sample box that clearly said “Don’t give away or you will break the set” in sharpie, right on the box. He had a smile but a degrading tone, a shit eater’s grin, and a nasty attitude literally over me saying “we aren’t suppose to give them out.” This is even after I had offered to show them the samples. They had attempted to belittle my coworker who was driving the forklift and me who was spotting him as they had stopped us to ask their idiotic question. They instantly went into anger from the thought of not getting their way. These are the people that live in St James NC.</p>\n<p>Being the humble person I am, I appologized for the inconvenience but he wasn’t having it. He wasn’t satisfied that he had stopped us from filling the lumber, or that he had his question answered. No he just wanted to feel superior to someone. To show that he had money and to degrade a reatail worker to attempt a cure at his impotence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts-on-retail-work\">Thoughts on Retail work</h2>\n<p>The point of this, as unbelievable as it is, was not to dissuade anyone from working retail. I did so for many years and had some good times in the process. You will meet some crazy people from all walks of life and you will learn a lot in the process. These lessons learned are that of life experience. Retail is also a good transitionary job for those looking switch careers. It can also help you live while going to school. The tough part is either working too hard, through work ethic or a ban manager, and not having the energy to leave this field, or having to work 40 hours to afford to live a basic existence. The exchange of time for money can leave you burned our when attempting to study for a better career at the same time. Providing 8 hours of sleep a night and a 9 hour work day, including the unpaid lunch, you are only left 7 hours in the day for everything else. This means less than 7 hours to get ready for work, commute, clean the house, clean yourself, and anything recreational. Realistically, youget maybe 2-3 hours a day of time you can study or work on a new career with out taking away from the other hours of the day. For instance, if you get less than 8 hours of sleep then you can study or go to school before work. This is a part of why many fall into the retail trap.</p>";

The barrier to entry is low enough that just about anyone can get in, while there are still some people that get rejected.\r\n\r\nWho gets rejected? The unfair bit of retail is the drug testing. People fail them all of the time. It is ultimately unfair to judge someone based on how they spend their free time. If someone were to apply for a position at a grocery store after their trip to Colorado then they could easily fail a drug test for something that is legal in another state. Controversial take, many people can trick drug tests so you only weed out the honest drug users. That being said you don't stop the crafty ones that are willing to lie and cheat to get a job.\r\n\r\nWhat about background checks? Those also pose a risk for potential employees. Most companies require a background check for felonies and sometimes even credit scores. This is supposed to weed out the dangerous people or those that might steal. This is just another way or biasing the system. There are plenty of nonviolent, non-theft related felonies, and as always this archaic system doesn't leave room for interpretation. Some places even require a credit check to show if someone is in debt. The though behind that is that those in debt are more willing to steal. Realistically speaking, if someone is going to steal, then they probably wouldn't be in debt in the first place. This is more of a way of sifting out the \"undesirables\" than a real measure of security. With most things, this should be left up to manager's discretion; however, most retail chains don't even trust their management teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Abundance of options\r\n\r\nAs a former hiring manager, I have first hand experience pulling from the application pool. Believe me when I say there was no real shortage of applicants. There may have been times in which we had more or less depending on the season but there was usually someone to call in for an interview. Qualification on the other hand was the problem. If I want to hire a supervisor and no one internal is qualified, then it might be a struggle to find an external hire to fill the position. That being said, the labor shortage is a more of a political buzzword than a reality. \r\n\r\nYes there may have been a shallower applicant pool during the pandemic, but generally speaking applicants are abundant when the pay and position is reasonable. Talk to HR and hiring manager and you'll find out that when the economy got tighter so did the hiring pool. I've seen job postings for software developers where the posting would collect 900 applications in 24 hours. How can there be a shortage of applicants for retail when there is such an abundance of developers? Pay and benefits. No one wants to work themselves to death for minimum wage. This isn't a labor shortage, this is a pay shortage. Working 40 hours a week for $7.25 an hour is less than $1200 a month. That wont even cover rent for most people. If there is a low number of applicants it is up to the company to adjust starting pay and benefits to make the position more enticing. \r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThere are a few benefits to working in retail. There is the low barrier to entry and the plethora of jobs. The fact that you don't need to have a formal education or a certain amount of experience means that just about anyone cane get a job. See the earlier section for the pitfalls. The abundance of jobs means that you can grab a job and work while getting into the field of your choice. Sometimes, at higher levels, the money is actually decent. For example, a Walmart store manager can start at $125,000 with the potential of a bonus that is 125% of that. I have personally seen store managers make $90,000 bonuses. That being said, you can also expect to spend the majority of your time and energy on the store.\r\n\r\nOne of the other main benefits is that you can learn on the job. Learning how to merchandise, increase sales, and properly service customers are skills that will carry over to any other field. Some places even have academies to send their management teams. While these skills might not be the best on a resume, they can carry over from company to company. Inventory control is essential to managing inventory flow, merchandising teaches visual styling, and customer service is a universal skill when in a front facing environment.\r\n\r\n## Trying to escape the world of retail\r\n\r\nThere exists a problem in which people start a retail job and then give up on their dreams. If anything it is a common joke among retail workers. People grab a job and then settle into that job. The problem is that the either exert all of their energy in that job or get too comfortable and stop looking for something better. \r\n\r\nSo what is the solution? Keep working on you skills in the field that you want to learn. Want to be a web developer? Keep making web sites. Want to work in IT? Study for the A+ or keep applying to entry level roles. \r\n\r\n have personally seen many people leave retail for a new career. I worked with someone that unloaded trucks and stocked. He went to school at the same time and later got a job as a diesel mechanic. This was a rare case in retail. I'm not saying that people can't escape the void of retail, but it isn't that common. Most of the people you see \"going to school\" live in a fantasy land where they take 1-2 just to say that they are in school. One girl that worked under me was always doing homework on her breaks, fast forward to 7-8 years later and she is still \"in school.\" For some it is a status symbol, for some it makes them feel more important, and for some it makes them have hope that they will have a better job one day. The real reason they never leave the world of retail is that they usually have job security and are scared of change.\r\n\r\n The trick is persistence and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. There is an old saying about growth only happens outside of your comfort zone. When we push ourselves to do something that makes us feel uncomfortable then we begin to understand our selves. When I first became a manager I wasn't sure of how to tell people what to do and was afraid of what people thought of me. The truth is that you always want people to like you, you just learn to be comfortable with telling people they are wrong. When you force yourself to confront an individual and solve a problem then you learn to better communicate your needs as well as that of the company. This mindset is something that is learned through experience. Some of the meanest managers I knew started out as push overs. Pushing yourself to grow in new ways is how you escape the retail hell by learning how to assimilate into a world outside of selling and stocking.\r\n \r\n### Existential Dread \r\n\r\nIf you look, you will find an abundance of escapism in the realm of retail workers. There is no shortage of existential dread for those in a dead end job. The question then becomes, does the job create the dread or are people that are lost and broken drawn to retail through a lack of ambition? The reality is a mix of both. Those that are lost or broken need to survive, the basis for which in our society is through monetary gains. The simplest for of which is through trading our time and energy for the ability to feed and shelter ourselves. The life that is then created is one of need. \r\n\r\nAccording to Maslow, we have a hierarchy of needs. Starting with our physiological needs, we have a duty to ourselves to fulfill those needs. Once we have adequately met the need for food, water, air, shelter, and anything else physical then we can move up the hierarchy of needs. The problem is that shelter is becoming increasingly difficult to procure on the retail salary. If one is in a constant state or worry about their physical needs, such as being able to eat or having a place to stay, then they cannot grow as a person or fulfill their other needs.\r\n\r\nThe next level of need we posses is that of safety. Once again, on a retail salary it can be difficult to obtain safety both through living arrangements and through that of our health care. America is especially known for having a horrendously expensive medical system. The truth is many have to face the choice of having a doctor's appointment or eating, and usually the baser need prevails. The mandated health insurance in America is a joke that only the rich laugh at. It provides a new burden to the working class in the form of hundreds of dollars a month that they do not have to spare while providing little to no benefit in terms of health care. A doctor's visit is still expensive enough to bankrupt most workers for a month and often health is neglected as the $300 visit may mean not being able to make ends meet. It's crazy how that little amount of money can make such a huge difference, and yet we are expected to pay that much to a company that only provides a security theater to our health.\r\n\r\nThe next need is love and belonging. Having all of the previous needs met means that we can focus our attentions on love and affection towards family and friends. This is often in a higher regard than the other needs, ie. the person that is more worried about getting lucky than their own safety and well-being. Most retail centers will have their fair share of secret lovers and intimate encounters. The same can be said of any social environment really. College, parties, and work are places where people are grouped together, either willingly or not, and are placed where connections are formed. This can be though shared suffering in the form of finals or working too many hours. It can also be through celebrations such as the end of finals, vacation, promotion, or whatever a party might be about. This creates an environment for us to fulfill our social needs and focus on something other than supporting ourselves. \r\n\r\nWhile some might argue that social interaction is over rated, it is an important part of existence, especially in retail. The next part of the hierarchy is esteem, something that often eludes those in retail. The esteem category includes our status in society, respect from others, recognition, and freedom. If you work a job that barely affords you a sense of physical security then chances are you don't feel free but are rather a wage slave. Working becomes a necessity and being able to change jobs, location, or schedules is not a luxury of this field. \r\n\r\nIn my tenure working retail I have amassed many horror stories of rude, angry, and degrading customers. People that make themselves feel better through making others miserable are abundant. They live for being rude and degrading to retail workers. Not a day goes by in which a retail worker doesn't have to deal with a rude customer and depending on their place of employment it can often be many rude customers a day. People treat you as if you are an imbecile for working to survive. They feel like retail is only for people that are inferior and that they should let those workers know just how pathetic they are. Respect is not only not given, but it is taken away from workers from the customers as well as the companies they serve. The low wages, the lying managers, and the pizza party instead of an actual incentives are just a few examples of how we are insulted by the company. For those retail workers that make it this far up the hierarchy, the esteem category is often one that will go unfulfilled. \r\n\r\nSelf-actualization is the capstone of the hierarchical pyramid. The desire to become a better person is often something with unfulfilled needs cannot achieve. This is the killer part of the existential dread. The fact is that you will not feel fulfilled unless you come to terms with your life and accept it as is. having your needs met is a great way to do this but working retail makes that in and of itself a challenge. It takes great mental prowess to overcome the other needs and feel like you are enough. Enough for your own life, enough for others to love, enough for anything. The sad truth is that most will never realize self actualization and in term spend their reality in a sense of unmotivated insufficiency. Others may spend their lives in a sense of delirium, choosing to ignore the fact that they are living paycheck to paycheck and ignoring other needs completely in the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Anecdotal Evidence\r\n\r\nThis is the part in which I share some of my personal experiences within my retail career. I share interactions, communications, and how they made me feel. This is not meant to discourage anyone from working retail but instead to shine a light on how they worker's are treated. I will share both positive and negative interactions with customers, management, and associates.\r\n\r\n### Fights Overnight\r\n\r\nThe first week overnight in one of the Wilmington stores I saw 3 homeless fights, a drug overdose, and an employee fight nearly happen. Having worked overnight before in previous stores I wasn't worried until I noticed how \"ghetto\" the store I was working in was. The first day there I parked next to a car with a person hanging out the driver's door. I addumed they were passed out asleep. When I went on lunch I noticed an ambulance taking them away. I felt responsible for a while until I realized that I didn't even consider they had OD'd. They had seemed unconscious but I have seen countless people sleep on the streets like that downtown. To me, they seemed asleep, passed out as if one had cunsumed too much the night before. I saw no syringe, or signs of drugs from what I saw but I felt bad none the less. \r\n\r\nThe first night there I saw a couple of homeless people fighting over beer thay they were drinking by the bathrooms. I had heard the manager that was showing me around start yelling while I was in the back and quickly ran to where he was. It turns out that there was two men arguing about something silly and throwing cans of beer as well as fists. As I arrived the other manager had broken them up long enough for the one homeless man to say \"he started it!\" I said something along the lines of \"I don't care who started it! You can't drink in the store, and you're making a mess and you have to leave.\" The one said \"I bought this beer and I have a reciept.\" In hindsight he probably just found a receipt int he parking lot and grabbed the same beer. I said something like \"I don't care, you've already destroyed half of it, just get out of here.\" \r\n\r\nI proceeded to see homeless fights, shoplifters, and recieved the occaisional death threat until something crazy happened. A little something called covid 19. They told me that they were going to shut down parts of the store and I thought they were crazy. They told me to wear a mask and contiue working like normal. Do the same amount of work while also doing temperature checks and shutting down the store. The upside to closing is that there were no homeless fights, no strippers coming in for the workers to get distracted by, and no one to mess up the store while we recovered from the mess we were left from the day crew. \r\n\r\n### Truck Loads of Fun\r\n\r\nWhen I was at UNCW I worked unloading trucks at Walmart. I have personally seen quite a few people get hurt while unloading trucks. I saw one person get hit in the head with a cast iron candle that someeone thought would be goot to put at the top of a rather unstable and large stack of boxes. As soon as he touched the one the candle came down from nearly 10 feet in the air and smacked him right in the side of the head. He immediately clutched his head and ran writhed in pain. Luckily it hit someone with a rather thick skull and he was alright but the way these trucks are loaded is not only dangerous, but idiotic at times. \r\n\r\nOne fun time I saw a pallet of water sitting on top of a pallet of TV's. I've seen crushed produce, whole pallets of dairy turned over and countless crushed boxes from carelessness in the wharehouse or through transit. Th half wrapped pallets and unsecured loads make tricky unloads. The already turned over egg and dairy pallets make for a slippery mess while also burning extra time cleaning up the mess, unloading, and through claiming out the damages. \r\n\r\nThere was one point, during the summer, where the trucks were so hot that even the candles would melt. I stuck my head in a melted candle once. If you have never experienced this kind of heat, then it is quite exhousting to work in, especially while constantly lifting upwards of 50 lbs.\r\n\r\nAt one point the unloader's job was to unload the GM truck, sort breakpacks ( mixed up boxes of freight ), unload and sort the grocery truck, and to pull everything out to the sales floor. There was a time in which I was the only person that showed up to work on 2nd shift IMS (The unload crew). As the only person it is impossible to unload 2000 pieces by yourself and do everything else in a day. With a team of sales associates I unloaded the truck, pulled and sorted the grocery truck by aisle, and sorted the breakpacks. All with time to spare. This was a feat that my older self probably couldn't, or at least wouldn't do. I then proceeded to deop a pallet on my foot while cleaning up and smash the end of my toe. With a bloody foot, I hobbled into the AD office and asked for a band aid. The Manager on duty looked at me and said \"ew gross. Don't get blood everywhere.\" There was no \"great job getting everything sorted\" and no \"Oh meh god, are you alright?!?!\" Instead I was just told I could leave early. Basically I had woked myself to death just to loose out on money from leaving early. What a deal. I wasn't told to fill out an incident report and I was just told to not bleed everywhere. He had even asked me if I could pull everything out to the floor with a bloody foot. This was the thanks for overachievement. \r\n\r\n### Thieving Coworkers\r\n\r\nI worked with a guy that would buy a drink at the register in electronics and say he already got the rest of the snacks he had, just to steal them and eat what wasn't his. \r\n\r\nI worked with a guy that would drink chocolate milk inside the dairy cooler and then place the empty cartons in the claims area. When management found out she had told him just don't do it anymore. He told her his family was hungry and that they weren't eating properly. This was a lie since he lived with his girlfriend's parents, who made sure their daughter and her baby were fed. This guy was also quite large for someone that would have been starving, and also brought a lunch every day. He then proceeded to steal steaks, yogurt, and drinks just for the sake of doing so. This went on until he finally quit to move to another state. \r\n\r\nOne set of cousines managed to steal thousands in electronics by sneaking it through the edge of the truck. They would go around and scoop up the dropped iPhones and iPads. They would talk about needing a new laptop and joke while dropping it through the hole. This went on for a while with the store knowing. All high ticket items are checked for on the trucks now to prevent this from happeneing. \r\n\r\nWherever there is commerce there is sure to be bad actors. \r\n\r\n### Lack of work ethics\r\n\r\nIn any position you will have people that do more and less than the average worker. This is just a fact of life. Not everyone performs at the same rate, yet they can get paid at the same rate. One of the most infuriating things is working hard to get something done just to be rewarded with more work than your co-workers. When you spend an entire day sweating just to see someone that makes more than you walk around and chat all day, it's beyond annoying. Every store will have your typical talker's that wonder around and BS all day. It's just a fact of retail. \r\n\r\nI once worked in a store that had a manager that would sleep while working overnight. He was an obese man that would exaggerate any achievement he had overnight while always talking down any other manager. He would act as if he could run any part of the store better than anyone else. My first night overnight, covering his vacation, I was told I did better than he ever did. When they told me I had to go overnight I was in a panic. I was affraid of failing. What I did was ask the people I knew did overnight well how they did it. I would also talk to all of the workers and see what they needed to get the job done. I prioritized what I knew the store manager looked for, since I toured with him many mornings, and I made sure the store was clean when I was walked off. Little did I know I would be walked off by the meanest and most senor ASM we had. Even though we were the same position her word was gold to the store manager. \r\n\r\nShe walked up and down most of the aisles in grocery, searching for any mistakes. Chekced the backroom looking for unworked freight and any messes. She couldn't find a thing. For the first time she actually gave me a compliment and said good job. When she told me that I did better than she ever saw the other guy do I was escstatic. But at the same time, the other manager that sucked and talked himself up made more than me. I had been screwed on my yearly raise by lying managers that were like a bunch of snakes, slowly strangling the life out of me. Now don't get me wrong, I got along with most of the team. That's why it hurt more when they stabbed me in the back by going out of their way to make me look bad while they themselves were horrible at their jobs. When the store manager doesn't leave the office and instead listens to a couple of snakes instead of the associates, you tend to get screwed. \r\n\r\nAfter proving my worth at that store I would often get punished with special assignments. As well as having to manage the backroom, grocery and consumables, I would also have to set up the store map and locations, plan and execute black fiday \"event\" day, and also close most of the time by myself.\r\n\r\n### Rude customers\r\n\r\nI worked in the garden center one summer and had an angry old man tell me that the plant's were dry. I said \"ok, we have someone that is watering them now.\" For some unknown reason the man said \"what are you gonna do, piss on them?\" My reaction was to say \"if that's what you want me to do.\" To this day I have no idea what that old prick wanted. Perhaps all he wanted was to argue with a low paid worker, maybe he wanted to feel important with his enlightened conclusion of the plant being dry, or most likely he wanted to get plants at a discount when they were absolutely fine. This is not out of the ordinary for a retail worker.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite things that customers do is threaten to go to the competition or stop shopping at XYZ big box store because of some minor inconveinience. This is hilarious to me since my paycheck will stay the same regardless. Most retail associates don't make commision, they don't get sales based incentives, and they are usually too overworked and underpaid to care. \r\n\r\nWorking at Lowes' lumber department you might get someone that wants a piece of plywood cut into precise dimensions a dozen different ways. When you inform them of the store policy of 2 cuts per board you get one of two reactions; understanding, or them trying to reason with you either through inferior logic or angry rants. These latter people will often threaten to go to Home Depot. Curiously enough, this is the same thing people will say if you don't carry whatever obscure piece of wood that they want. They thruth is that this is a meaningless threat to someone that isn't paid enough to afford their basic necessities, let alone pay any mind to these silly gestures. \r\n\r\nI had an elderly man try to buy a gun one time. He had trouble entering his information in the computer to fill out the proper 4473 form. I told him repeatedly that I couldn't fill the form out for him without a 3rd party witness, and since I was the only manager at the time I couldn't have another sign off on me inputing his answers for him. This was a perk of being short staffed. I needed my sporting goods associate to verify the form and for myself to sign off on the transaction, thus I could not be involved in the filling out of the form. I spent 45 minutes explaining how the computer worked and showing him how to type in his answers. I helped him get back up to where he was but in his frustrations he continued to berate me and tell me that I \"must not want to make the sale\" and that \"the other store's would have filled it out.\" After I explained the law again, he told me to \"take that gun, shove it up your ass, and pull the triger.\" I finally broke and told him I wouldn't do the sale. I told him I was refusing him due to his attitude and the fact that he clearly was unstable. I later found this man in electronics yelling at one of my workers and asking for their name. I intervened and told hime \"she doesn't have to give you her last name.\" He asked for my badge number, which is hilarious since we aren't cops, and I told him to leave. He asked for my full name and where I lived, to which I gave it to him. Telling him if he wanted to drive the 70 miles to see me he could. Literally 2 days later the man came in the store and apologized to me for being an asshole. This was a coutesy that most won't extend.\r\n\r\nEven though I try to approach everyone with respect, there are always customer that will degrade you to make themselves feel better. \r\n\r\nOne man and his wife had asked if we had samples of trex they could take home. I informed them that the samples where in a box and we weren't allowed to give them away, espescially since we wouldn't be able to show anyone else that color without ordering an entire new box and waiting on it to come in. This answer wasn't good enough for this smug old yankee. He quickly said \"oh what is Lowes hurting for money? Should I just reach in my pocket and give them something? You guys look tired and like you don't even want to be here.\" This part was true as I had been working for 7 hours with out as much as a bathroom break at that point. \r\n\r\nHe then said \"you look unmotivated. What, they don't pay you enough to be motivated?\" Bear in mind that this is just because I wouldn't let him take part of a sample box that clearly said \"Don't give away or you will break the set\" in sharpie, right on the box. He had a smile but a degrading tone, a shit eater's grin, and a nasty attitude literally over me saying \"we aren't suppose to give them out.\" This is even after I had offered to show them the samples. They had attempted to belittle my coworker who was driving the forklift and me who was spotting him as they had stopped us to ask their idiotic question. They instantly went into anger from the thought of not getting their way. These are the people that live in St James NC. \r\n\r\nBeing the humble person I am, I appologized for the inconvenience but he wasn't having it. He wasn't satisfied that he had stopped us from filling the lumber, or that he had his question answered. No he just wanted to feel superior to someone. To show that he had money and to degrade a reatail worker to attempt a cure at his impotence.  \r\n\r\n## Thoughts on Retail work\r\n\r\nThe point of this, as unbelievable as it is, was not to dissuade anyone from working retail. I did so for many years and had some good times in the process. You will meet some crazy people from all walks of life and you will learn a lot in the process. These lessons learned are that of life experience. Retail is also a good transitionary job for those looking switch careers. It can also help you live while going to school. The tough part is either working too hard, through work ethic or a ban manager, and not having the energy to leave this field, or having to work 40 hours to afford to live a basic existence. The exchange of time for money can leave you burned our when attempting to study for a better career at the same time. Providing 8 hours of sleep a night and a 9 hour work day, including the unpaid lunch, you are only left 7 hours in the day for everything else. This means less than 7 hours to get ready for work, commute, clean the house, clean yourself, and anything recreational. Realistically, youget maybe 2-3 hours a day of time you can study or work on a new career with out taking away from the other hours of the day. For instance, if you get less than 8 hours of sleep then you can study or go to school before work. This is a part of why many fall into the retail trap. ";
