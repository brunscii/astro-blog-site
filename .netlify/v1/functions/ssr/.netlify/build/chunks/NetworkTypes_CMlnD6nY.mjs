Whether you are connecting IOT, computers, wireless devices, or anything in between; there is a network type that is ideal for each occation.\r\n\r\nThe main network types are:\r\n1) Persona Area Network (PAN)\r\n2) Local Area Network (LAN)\r\n3) Metropolatan Area Network (MAN)\r\n4) Wide Area Network (WAN)\r\n\r\nAmong there there are sub categories and specialty networks such as Storage Area Network (SAN) and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).\r\n\r\n### Personal Area Network (PAN)\r\n \r\nThis is a form of network that is between a small number of devices and has limited range. Think of bluetooth from you phone to your speaker, your controller to your game console, your remote to your TV, your watch to your phone, your mouse to your computer and so on and so forth. When there is a connection between peripherals or smaller devices there is usually a PAN.\r\n\r\n### Local Area Network (LAN)\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most common forms of networks. It describes a network that is confined to an area such as a builing or house. This network is used to connect devices through the use of switches, which are devices that send data to specific devices. A LAN can be used to connect multiple devices to one internet connection like in a home network. Think about how your phone, computer, and game console can all connect to the internet at the same time. This is thanks to the switch and the router.

Routers can also be used to connect multiple switches together in order to form a network of smaller networks. \r\n\r\nFor a list of the WLAN types, please visit [this](../wirelesstypes)\r\n\r\n### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)\r\n\r\nThis is not a gender based network. This is a network that connects smaller networks around a city. Think about a college campus. With every building having it's own LAN network, you can connect them all together to make a MAN. Sometimes the campus MAN is called a campus network. MAN's are often between 3 and 30 miles. Some companies and government buildings might use a MAN to communicate between different buildings located at a distance. \r\n\r\n### Wide Area Network (WAN)\r\n\r\nA WAN is a network that stretches over a large distance. Imagine a single school that uses a LAN network. It can be connected to the other schools in the region using a WAN network, either directly or through the internet. Since each school is far apart they will often just group the LAN networks of each school in a way that is comprehensive for the system administrator. The system administrator will often be in charge or maintaining the WAN all the way down to the individual LAN and individual devices. This connectivity is ideal for the larger networks separated by a large distance.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nSo what would you call the internet? \r\n- The internet is a WAN as it covers large distances and many networks.\r\n\r\nWhat is my companies network?\r\n- Most likily it uses a LAN of some sort. \r\n- Most companies have WLANs setup. Sometimes you may have a few buildings networked together in a MAN, but this is not a common occurance unless you have multiple buildings in a city on the same network pysically connected. Most of the time you will have a LAN network setup for the emplyees and a VPN for remote workers to connect to the LAN. \r\n\r\nWhat network does my smart watch use? \r\n- There is usually a PAN connection to your phone. \r\n- Many can also use the Wi-Fi to connect to the WLAN.\r\n- Some even have a direct acces to the WAN via a a cellular link, this allows use as a phone without being connected to or in range of your phone.\r\n\r\nWhat are some examples of a MAN?\r\n- A cable connection is considered a MAN, as it is spread over a city and connects many down taps together to a satellite feed.\r\n- WiMax, which is a sebset of IEEE 802.16, is a MAN since it connects using microwave at large distances.\r\n\r\n";
