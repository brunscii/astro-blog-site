In RAID 5 the data is striped across all disks and a parity bit is added for redundancy. This data is used to store the calculation from the XOR of the striped data.

It is a combination of RAID 1’s mirroring process as well as the striping process of RAID 0. This offers both speed and reliability. The downside is that it requires twice as many drives to acheive the same storage as a simple RAID 0 and is also slower since it has to mirror the data from the array. The benefits are the increased speed over RAID 1 as well as the ability to withstand a drive failure unlike RAID 0.</p>\n<h2 id=\"which-raid-should-i-use\">Which RAID should I use?</h2>\n<p>That all depends on your needs. If you need a fast read and write and aren’t worried about data loss then RAID 0 just might be for you. Perhaps you need speed but also value your data, in that case there is RAID 10.
