# Astro Blog Site

## About
This is a site I made using the blog template in Astro. While it came with some well written
code for converting md files into blog posts and cool tricks like a [...slug].astro file, I have still done some major modifications in almost every file. 

The blog posts themselves are my original content. I plan on hosting this blog on my personal domain, christopherjcarlin.com.  

## The Blog
The point of this blog is for me to post idead and concepts that I find interesting. These can be 
 - reference material
    - IT documentation
    - A+ Terms
    - Networking technologies
    - Server configuration
    - Programming concepts
    - Security concepts
 - Things I am learning
    - Typescript
    - React
    - Astro
    - Welding
    - Building in the shop
    - Car Issues
    - Literally anything
 - Things I find interesting
    - Psychology
    - Philosophy
    - Audio gear
    - Books and Movies
    - Hardware

Seems like a long list right? Well, I plan to separate things into categories to keep things clean and easy to find.
Clearly if I want to look through my personal reference material then it doesn't make sense to look through my personal
book reviews and philosophy musings. This is where a tagging system comes in handy as well as sorting the blogs into different lists. 

The list of todo's is long but managable. 

Reference material is meant to serve as a way for me to not only learn, through writing, but also through rereading in a future date. 
This means I will learn a subject through writing about it, then verify all of the information and publish it to the blog. This material 
will have a reference tag if I think it will be valuable to myself and others. For example, if I were to study for an A+ certification then 
I can create a list of terms and definitions in the reference tag. This allows me to remember through note taking as well as providing a 
useful study material. 

Things I am learning serves to show my progress as I learn. It is a valuable exercise to look back on how far you have come. This is 
espescially true for battling imposter syndrome and boosting confidence. It can also help others with similar problems. I don't consider this
referece material since I might not actually verify that the information is 100% correct or best practice. I can also use this space to 
post about things I am building with wood, metal, hardware, or software. This is a mix of documenting progress and having fun with building,
in the rare case I get a chance. 

Things I find interesting serves as a way to share my interests and show I am human. I enjoy thinking and sharing thoughts with others. 
This is where a comment section will come in handy. What's the point of sharing if you can't have discourse right? This isn't meant as a way
to spread any narrative, but instead as a way to share on how certain things make me feel. It also allows me to share about books and movies
I consume, audio gear and hardware I have or want, and strange things.
