# Astro Blog Site

## About
This is a site I made using the blog template in Astro. While it came with some well written
code for converting md files into blog posts and cool tricks like a [...slug].astro file, I have still done some major modifications in almost every file. 

The blog posts themselves are my original content. I plan on hosting this blog on my personal domain, christopherjcarlin.com.  

## The Blog
The point of this blog is for me to post ideas and concepts that I find interesting. These can be 
 - Reference material
    - IT documentation
    - A+ Terms
    - Networking technologies
    - Server configuration
    - Programming concepts
    - Security concepts
 - Things I am learning
    - Typescript
    - React
    - Astro
    - Wood working
    - Welding
 - Things I find interesting
    - Psychology
    - Philosophy
    - Audio gear
    - Books and Movies
    - Hardware

Seems like a long list right? Well, I plan to separate things into categories to keep things clean and easy to find.
Clearly if I want to look through my personal reference material then it doesn't make sense to look through my personal
book reviews and philosophy musings. This is where a tagging system comes in handy as well as sorting the blogs into different lists. 

The list of todo's is long but managable.
