# Astro Blog Site

## About
This is a site I made using the blog template in Astro. While it came with some well written
code for converting md files into blog posts and cool tricks like a [...slug].astro file, I have still done some major modifications in almost every file. 

This serves as a way for me to remember specific concepts, share ideas, and document my processes.

## The Blog
The point of this blog is for me to post ideas and concepts that I find interesting. These can be 
 - Personal reference material style
    - IT documentation
    - A+, Security+, Network+ study Terms
    - Networking technologies
    - Server configuration
    - Programming concepts
    - Security concepts
 - Things I am always learning
    - Typescript, React, Astro, Python, C...
    - Linux Server/Home Lab
    - Wood working
    - Welding
    - Automotive work
 - Things I find interesting
    - Books and Movies
    - Hardware
    - Psychology
    - Philosophy
    - Audio gear

Seems like a long list right? Well, I plan to separate things into categories to keep things clean and easy to find.
Clearly if I want to look through my personal reference material then it doesn't make sense to look through my personal
book reviews and philosophy musings. This is where a tagging system comes in handy as well as sorting the blogs into different lists. 

The list of todo's is long but managable.
