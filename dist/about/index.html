			<h1>About</h1>			
			<p>
				This blog is meant as a place for me to drop musing and concepts about tech. 
				It is a mix of reference material and notebook, allowing me to dump my brain 
				and not worry about forgetting important concepts. Some of the blog posts will
				be intended to serve as a will be marked as such. Others will be thoughts, reviews,
				or just ideas that I wish to write down. The goal here is to share knowledge with
				myself as well as others. 
			</p>
            <p>
                Some of the goals of this blog are to create references and articles that are written in a similar format.
                This probably won't be anything as large and robust as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a>,
                Mozilla Developer's Network, which I use quite often. This is meant to be more of a small scale reference and a way for me to 
                practice my writing. The concepts won't be as focused as MDN either, as I will have a broad range of topics to cover and not
                just web development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the rare occasions that I decide to write personal content, I will probably tag it as such, or possible branch it into a separate 
                area of the site. This way I don't interefere with the flow of the site. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideally all blog posts will have tags as to what the blog regards, whether A+ study material, Hardware, Software, Programming, 
                Web Development, React, Astro, Linux, and so on and so forth.
