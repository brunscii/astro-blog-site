			<p>
				This blog is mean as a place for me to drop musing and concepts about tech. 
				It is a mix of reference material and notebook, allowing me to dump my brain 
				and not worry about forgetting important concepts. Some of the blog posts will
				be intended to serve as a will be marked as such. Others will be thoughts, reviews,
				or just ideas that I wish to write down. The goal here is to share knowledge with
				myself as well as others.
