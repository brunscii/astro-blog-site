## Wifi Types

There have been many iterations of the IEEE 802.11 standard over the years. This is the standard that is used for Wi-Fi devices and how they connect to one another. 

The following chart shows the different Wi-Fi iterations, link rate, and their radio frequencies:

| Generation / Version |	IEEE Standard	| Adopted |	Maximum link rate (Mbit/s)	| Radio frequency (GHz) | Range (feet) Indoor - Outdoor|
| ---| ---      | ---  | ---              | ---     | --- |
| 0	 | 802.11	  | 1997 | 1 to 2           |	2.4     |  66 - 330 |
| 1	 | 802.11b	| 1999 | 1 to 11          |	2.4     | 115 - 460 |
| 2	 | 802.11a	| 1999 | 6 to 54          |	5       | 115 - 390 |
| 3	 | 802.11g	| 2003 | 6 to 54          |	2.4     | 125 - 460 |
| 4	 | 802.11n	| 2008 | 72 to 600	      | 2.4/5   | 230 - 820 |
| 5	 | 802.11ac |	2014 | 433 to 6933	    | 5[5]    | 150 - 315 |
| 6	 | 802.11ax | 2019 | 574 to 9608[3]   | 2.4/5   |  98 - 390 |
| 6E | 802.11ax |	2020 | 574 to 9608[3]	  | 6[4]    |  98 - 390 |
| 7  | 802.11be	| TBD  | 1376 to 46120	  | 2.4/5/6 |  98 - 390 | 

Most Wireless devices made now have wi-fi 5 or 6, that is AC or AX. Most AC routers can also support older standards like n and g. This is similar to how the g routers supported b eventhough most devices didnt use it by that time.
