Among there there are sub categories and specialty networks such as Storage Area Network (SAN) and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).

## Personal Area Network (PAN)
 
This is a form of network that is between a small number of devices and has limited range. Think of bluetooth from you phone to your speaker, your controller to your game console, your remote to your TV, your watch to your phone, your mouse to your computer and so on and so forth. When there is a connection between peripherals or smaller devices there is usually a PAN.
