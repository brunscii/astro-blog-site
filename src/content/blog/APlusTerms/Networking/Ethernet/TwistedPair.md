## UTP vs STP

UTP, or Unsheilded Twisted Pair, is a common type of network cable. Some examples are standard Cat5 and Cat6 ethernet cables.
UTP cables are great when nominal levels of EMI, Electromagnetic Interference, is present. These cables consist of twisted pairs of cables that help reduce interference, however they do not have a shielding around the cable itself.

STP, or Shielded Twisted Pair, is a twisted pair cable that has an outer layer of shielding to prevent EMI. The outer shielding is usually a mesh or wire that blocks radio waves similar to a Faraday cage.

UTP cables are more common due to them being inexpensive and having more flexibility. STP cables are usually stiffer and more expensive leading to them being used more sparingly.

## Cat5 through Cat7

For the most part, networks are comprised of Cat 5e through Cat 7 cables. The Cat is the Category and the number is similar to a generation.

### Cat 5 and 5e

Cat 5 and 5e are commonn in older networks or ones that don't need a higher bandwidth. Cat 5 can run at 100 Mbps at 100MHz over 100 meters. 
Cat 5e, on the other hand, is a newer form of Cat 5 that has been used since 2001. Cat5e can run at 1Gbps at 350MHz over 100 meters.

Cat 5e is a cheap alterative to Cat 6 for short runs or slower networks. If you need a cable for connecting devices at gigabit speed then Cay 5e will work just fine. It is not recommended for newer networks since most routers and computers support 2.5Gbps now. 

If your internet is not faster than 1Gbps then do you need a faster cable?
The answer is that is depends on your network. If you do not need to transfer files between devices then Cat 5e should work for you. If you have a NAS or multiple devices communicating, and you have a faster than gigabit NIC, then you should consider faster cables. If you want to build a network that has more room to grow, then you should also consider a newer cable.
