## UTP vs STP

UTP, or Unsheilded Twisted Pair, is a common type of network cable. Some examples are standard CAT5 and CAT6 ethernet cables.
UTP cables are great when nominal levels of EMI, Electromagnetic Interference, is present. These cables consist of twisted pairs of cables that help reduce interference, however they do not have a shielding around the cable itself.

STP, or Shielded Twisted Pair, is a twisted pair cable that has an outer layer of shielding to prevent EMI. The outer shielding is usually a mesh or wire that blocks radio waves similar to a Faraday cage.

UTP cables are more common due to them being inexpensive and having more flexibility. STP cables are usually stiffer and more expensive leading to them being used more sparingly.

## CAT5 through CAT7

For the most part, networks are comprised of CAT 5e through CAT 7 cables. Some older networks may have CAT3 and some newer ones might have CAT 8. The CAT is the category and the number is similar to a generation.
