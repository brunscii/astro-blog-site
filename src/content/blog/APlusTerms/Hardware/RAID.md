## What is RAID?

RAID, or Redundant Array of Independent Disks, is a way for configuring your storage devices. There are different arrays for different needs; whether it be redundancy, speed, or both. Hardware RAID is not as common as it use to be since ZFS and brtfs both have their own versions with their own benefits and pitfalls.

## Types of RAID

| RAID Type | Speed | redundancy | number of drives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| RAID 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| RAID 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| RAID 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| RAID 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| RAID 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
