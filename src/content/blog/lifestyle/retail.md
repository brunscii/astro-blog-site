## What's the point?

For millions of Americans working retail is a reality that they can't escape. Over the last decade I have worked in retail, from stocker to management, and have met people from just about every background. From business owners to former IT workers, people from all walks of life flock to retail positions. The real question is why, what are the benefits, downfalls, and is it for you.

I just want to start by saying that retail workers are an essential part of our economy. Without people to stock shelves, run registers, clean, and everything in between; then there would be no commerce. That being said the retail worker is considered one of the lowest forms of employee. Why is this? Is it the barrier to entry for these positions? Is it the abundance of people that will work the position? Is it the lack of skill required for the position? Perhaps it is a mix of these things that keeps the retail worker in the shadows.

### Barrier to entry

With the low barrier to entry anyone can apply and get a job in the field. There is literally a job for anyone. Can't run a register, you can probably push a broom around. Can't push a broom, you can probably check reciepts or spot people with equipment. Can't deal with people, there's always the accounting/cash side of things. In my tenure I have worked with many disabled people that were able to work and provide value to the overall store. You can think of working at a big retailer like community college. The barrier to entry is low enough that just about anyone can get in, while there are still some people that get rejected.

Who gets rejected? The unfair bit of retail is the drig testing. People fail them all of the time. It is ultimately unfair to judge someone based on how they spend their free time. If someone were to apply for a position at a grocery store after their trip to Colorado then they could easily fail a drug test for something that is legal in another state. Controvertial take, many people can trick drug tests so you only weed out the honest drug users. That being said you don't stop the crafty ones that are willing to lie and cheat to get a job.

What about background checks? Those also pose a risk for potential employees. Most companies require a background check for felonies and sometimes even credit scores. This is supposed to weed out the dangerous people or those that might steal. This is just another way or biasing the system. There are plenty of nonviolent, nontheft related felonies, and as always this archaic system doesn't leave room for interpretation. Some places even require a credit check to show if someone is in debt. The though behind that is that those in debt are more willing to steal. Realistically speaking, if someone is goind to steal, then they probably wouldn't be in debt in the first place. This is more of a way of sifting out the "undesirables" than a real measure of security. With most things, this should be left up to manager's discretion; however, most retail chains don't even trust their management teams.


### Abundance of options

As a former hiring manager, I have first hand experience pulling from the application pool. Believe me when I say there was no real shortage of applicants. There may have been times in which we had more or less depending on the season but there was usually someone to call in for an interview. Qualification on the other hand was the problem. If I want to hire a supervisor and no one internal is qualified, then it might be a struggle to find an external hire to fill the position. That being said, the labor shortage is a more of a politcal buzzword than a reality. 

Yes there may have been a shallower applicant pool during the pandemic, but generally speaking applicants are abundant when the pay and position is reasonable. Talk to HR and hiring manager and you'll find out that when the economy got tighter so did the hiring pool. I've seen job postings for software developers where the posting would collect 900 applications in 24 hours. How can there be a shortage of applicants for retail when there is such an abundance of developers? Pay and benefits. No one wants to work themselves to death for minimum wage. This isn't a labor shortage, this is a pay shortage. Working 40 hours a week for $7.25 an hour is less than $1200 a month. That wont even cover rent for most people. If there is a low number of applicants it is up to the company to adjust starting pay and benefits to make the position more enticing.
