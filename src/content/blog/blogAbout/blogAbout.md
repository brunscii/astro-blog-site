# About Chris's Blog

## What is this?

Have you ever looked something up only to realize that it's something that you have learned before? This is a place for me to put notes that I can look back on as a refresher. The information I post here may be helpful to others but it mainly just my musings and thoughts. The main focus is probably going to be programming or tech in general. For sure there will be deep dives into command-line tools and programming features.  

## Why a blog?

Simply put, I like writing in markdown and it makes for a decent style of blog. Writing is satisfying and it allows me to organize my thoughts. Writing this information down forces me to structure the information first. It also makes me dive deeper into concepts than I normally would. Between these two things, I hope that it will help me to retain information better. If not, then at least I will have a quick not on what information I forgot.

## Formatting

This is going to be written in Markdown. I like the way it takes notes and it allows me to add structure to the notes with headings, tables, lists, blockquotes, links, images, and syntax highlighting. Markdown is also a common practice in writing blogs. It is easy to convert into html and is already structured. There are ton's of tutorials on creating your own blog site using different frameworks that all use markdown for the blog writing.

The basic structure shoudl be something like this:

    [Title]
    [Short description]
    
    [section]
        [subsection]
            [information for subsection]
        [subsection]
            [information for subsection]
        [subsection]
            [information for subsection]
    [section]
        [subsection]
            [information for subsection]
        ...

Seems basic, right? It all depends on the content. As we say, "content is king."
There are a few things I'll try to stick to.
- Try to include images for visual learners like myself
- Syntax highlight when possible
- Do the research
- All technical information should able to be used as documentation

That being said, not all of this will be tech documents and tutorials. This will probably also have a section for reviews, commentary, and things I think are cool.

Using markdown for this means I can use the same formatting for each blog via CSS. If need be, we could also create a separate style for each blog by displaying them as a class using the file name. This is just a speculation for now though. I still have to make the blog display so who knows what will happen.
