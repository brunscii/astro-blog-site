## What is it?
CIFS, or common internet file system, is a form of IP based file sharing protocol. 
It has since been replaced with SMB and NFS.

Basically speaking, CIFS is a way of having a network shared set of files that can be accessed by authenticated users. Imaging a network shared folder being accessed by a user on the network.
