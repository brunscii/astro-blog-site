## What is bubble sort?

Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms and is rarely used in the real world.
But I thought simplicity is desired in algorithms? Yeah, and so is efficiency. 
Bubble sort is not the fastest with a O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity.

So, what are the advantages?

For any type of sorting you have to do, there is almost always a better sorting algorithm out there. This one, however, is a good one to learn just to learn the basics of algorithms.
