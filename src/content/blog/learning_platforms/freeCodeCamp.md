## What is freeCodeCamp

As the name says, freeCodeCamp is a free code camp. It is a wealth of knowledge and courses that allows for students to work at their own pace. 
No deadlines, no costs, and no hassle is how freeCodeCamp operates. They offer a range of certificates that each require the completion of special projects.
The certs range from Front End development to Data Analysis with Python and Pandas.

As someone who has completed some of these certificates while learning, this review is a first hand look at my experience.
