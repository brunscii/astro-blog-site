## What is freeCodeCamp

As the name says, freeCodeCamp is a free code camp. It is a wealth of knowledge and courses that allows for students to work at their own pace. 
No deadlines, no costs, and no hassle is how freeCodeCamp operates. They offer a range of certificates that each require the completion of special projects.
The certs range from Front End development to Data Analysis with Python and Pandas.

As someone who has completed some of these certificates while learning, this review is a first hand look at my experience. 

## What do they offer?

freeCode camp offers certificates in:
- Responsive Web Design
- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- Front End Development Libraries
- Data Visualization
- Relational Database
- Back End Development
- Quality Assurance
- Scientific Computing with Python
- Data Analysis with Python
- Information Security
- Machine Learning with Python
- College Algrbra with Python
- A2 English for Developers
- Foundational C# with Microsoft

They also offer interview prep stuff such as:
- The Odin Project
- Coding Interview Prep
- Project Euler
- Rosetta Code

This is an ever-growing list of coursework that is free. Free as in free beer, not freedom of expression. 
The only cost is the time you spend on learning and making projects.

## What I learned

As someone who learned web development through freeCodeCamp I may be somewhat biased. That being said, I do love how easy they make learning.
The site breaks down simple concepts like CSS, HTML, and JavaScript into bite sized chunks. 
The REACT and Redux parts of the Front End Development Libraries course where much harder but still manageable.

I have completed the Responsive Web Development, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, and the Front End Libraries certificates. 
I am currently working on the Data Analysis with Python cert and love working dataframes.
The course could use more information on how to use seaborn and matplotlib but once again, YouTube helps to save the day. 

freeCodeCamp has many YouTube videos on computer science subjects from multiple teachers. 
Many of these videos being hours long and full on great information. 
These videos are great when watched in chunks and follow along with the instructor.

I am planning on finishing the Data Visualization cert, wich teaches D3.js and SVG manipulation, and working on the Back End cert next. 
Honestly, all of these certs sound fun and useful given the time to complete them.

fCC claims that it takes around 300 hours to complete each cert. This is possible for the uninitiated, however existing developers and computer science grads may take less time. 
In my personal experience each curriculum took much less than 300 hours to complete. That being said, if it takes you 300 hours then that is ok as well.
The information in the curriculum is enough to get started, but oftne requires additional information from their 9000+ articles and tutorials. 
What helped me the most if finding YouTube channels that focused on web development and watching their tips and tricks until I became fluent in the lingo.
This helped the most with learnign REACT.
